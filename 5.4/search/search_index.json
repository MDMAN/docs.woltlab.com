For now we'll keep it as it is. The PHP Class # The next step is to create the PHP class which will serve our page: Create the directory files in the same directory where package.xml is located Open files and create the directory lib Open lib and create the directory page Within the directory page , please create the file TestPage.class.php Copy and paste the following code into the TestPage.class.php : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 <? php namespace wcf\\page ; use wcf\\system\\WCF ; /** * A simple test page for demonstration purposes. * * @author YOUR NAME * @license GNU Lesser General Public License <http://opensource.org/licenses/lgpl-license.php> */ class TestPage extends AbstractPage { /** * @var string */ protected $greet = '' ; /** * @inheritDoc */ public function readParameters () { parent :: readParameters (); if ( isset ( $_GET [ 'greet' ])) $this -> greet = $_GET [ 'greet' ]; } /** * @inheritDoc */ public function readData () { parent :: readData (); if ( empty ( $this -> greet )) { $this -> greet = 'World' ; } } /** * @inheritDoc */ public function assignVariables () { parent :: assignVariables (); WCF :: getTPL () -> assign ([ 'greet' => $this -> greet ]); } } The class inherits from wcf\\page\\AbstractPage , the default implementation of pages without form controls. It defines quite a few methods that will be automatically invoked in a specific order, for example readParameters() before readData() and finally assignVariables() to pass arbitrary values to the template. The property $greet is defined as World , but can optionally be populated through a GET variable ( index.php?test/&greet=You would output Hello You! ). This extra code illustrates the separation of data processing that takes place within all sort of pages, where all user-supplied data is read from within a single method. It helps organizing the code, but most of all it enforces a clean class logic that does not start reading user input at random places, including the risk to only escape the input of variable $_GET['foo'] 4 out of 5 times. Reading and processing the data is only half the story, now we need a template to display the actual content for our page. You don't need to specify it yourself, it will be automatically guessed based on your namespace and class name, you can read more about it later . Last but not least, you must not include the closing PHP tag ?> at the end, it can cause PHP to break on whitespaces and is not required at all. The Template # Navigate back to the root directory of your package until you see both the files directory and the package.xml . Now create a directory called templates , open it and create the file test.tpl . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 { include file = 'header' } <div class=\"section\"> Hello { $greet } ! </div> { include file = 'footer' } Templates are a mixture of HTML and Smarty-like template scripting to overcome the static nature of raw HTML. The above code will display the phrase Hello World! in the application frame, just as any other page would render. The included templates header and footer are responsible for the majority of the overall page functionality, but offer a whole lot of customization abilities to influence their behavior and appearance. The Page Definition # The package now contains the PHP class and the matching template, but it is still missing the page definition. Please create the file page.xml in your project's root directory, thus on the same level as the package.xml . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <data xmlns= \"http://www.woltlab.com\" xmlns:xsi= \"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation= \"http://www.woltlab.com http://www.woltlab.com/XSD/2019/page.xsd\" > <import> <page identifier= \"com.example.test.Test\" > <controller> wcf\\page\\TestPage </controller> <name language= \"en\" > Test Page </name> <pageType> system </pageType> </page> </import> </data> You can provide a lot more data for a page, including logical nesting and dedicated handler classes for display in menus. Building the Package # If you have followed the above guidelines carefully, your package directory should now look like this: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 \u251c\u2500\u2500 files \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 lib \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 page \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 TestPage.class.php \u251c\u2500\u2500 package.xml \u251c\u2500\u2500 page.xml \u2514\u2500\u2500 templates \u2514\u2500\u2500 test.tpl Both files and templates are archive-based package components, that deploy their payload using tar archives rather than adding the raw files to the package file. Please create the archive files.tar and add the contents of the files/* directory, but not the directory files/ itself. Repeat the same process for the templates directory, but this time with the file name templates.tar . Place both files in the root of your project. Last but not least, create the package archive com.example.test.tar and add all the files listed below. files.tar package.xml page.xml templates.tar The archive's filename can be anything you want, all though it is the general convention to use the package name itself for easier recognition. Installation # Open the Administration Control Panel and navigate to Configuration > Packages > Install Package , click on Upload Package and select the file com.example.test.tar from your disk. Follow the on-screen instructions until it has been successfully installed. Open a new browser tab and navigate to your newly created page. If WoltLab Suite is installed at https://example.com/wsc/ , then the URL should read https://example.com/wsc/index.php?test/ . Congratulations, you have just created your first package! Developer Tools # This feature is available with WoltLab Suite 3.1 or newer only. The developer tools provide an interface to synchronize the data of an installed package with a bare repository on the local disk. You can re-import most PIPs at any time and have the changes applied without crafting a manual update. This process simulates a regular package update with a single PIP only, and resets the cache after the import has been completed. Registering a Project # Projects require the absolute path to the package directory, that is, the directory where it can find the package.xml . It is not required to install an package to register it as a project, but you have to install it in order to work with it. It does not install the package by itself! There is a special button on the project list that allows for a mass-import of projects based on a search path. Each direct child directory of the provided path will be tested and projects created this way will use the identifier extracted from the package.xml . Synchronizing # The install instructions in the package.xml are ignored when offering the PIP imports, the detection works entirely based on the default filename for each PIP. On top of that, only PIPs that implement the interface wcf\\system\\devtools\\pip\\IIdempotentPackageInstallationPlugin are valid for import, as it indicates that importing the PIP multiple times will have no side-effects and that the result is deterministic regardless of the number of times it has been imported. Some built-in PIPs, such as sql or script , do not qualify for this step and remain unavailable at all times. However, you can still craft and perform an actual package update to have these PIPs executed. Appendix # Template Guessing # The class name including the namespace is used to automatically determine the path to the template and its name. The example above used the page class name wcf\\page\\TestPage that is then split into four distinct parts: wcf , the internal abbreviation of WoltLab Suite Core (previously known as WoltLab Community Framework) \\page\\ (ignored) Test , the actual name that is used for both the template and the URL Page (page type, ignored) The fragments 1. and 3. from above are used to construct the path to the template: <installDirOfWSC>/templates/test.tpl (the first letter of Test is being converted to lower-case).","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"getting-started/#creating-a-simple-package","text":"","title":"Creating a simple package"},{"location":"getting-started/#setup-and-requirements","text":"This guide will help you to create a simple package that provides a simple test page.

You can learn about basic TypeScript use in WoltLab Suite, such as consuming WoltLab Suite\u2019s types in own packages, within in the TypeScript section . The History of the Legacy API # The WoltLab Suite 3.0 introduced a new API based on AMD-Modules with ES5-JavaScript that was designed with high performance and visible dependencies in mind. This was a fundamental change in comparison to the legacy API that was build many years before while jQuery was still a thing and we had to deal with ancient browsers such as Internet Explorer 9 that felt short in both CSS and JavaScript capabilities. Fast forward a few years, the old API is still around and most important, it is actively being used by some components that have not been rewritten yet. This has been done to preserve the backwards-compatibility and to avoid the significant amount of work that it requires to rewrite a component. The components invoked on page initialization have all been rewritten to use the modern API, but some deferred objects that are invoked later during the page runtime may still use the old API. However, the legacy API is deprecated and you should not rely on it for new components at all. It slowly but steadily gets replaced up until a point where its last bits are finally removed from the code base. Embedding JavaScript inside Templates # The <script> -tags are extracted and moved during template processing, eventually placing them at the very end of the body element while preserving their order of appearance. This behavior is controlled through the data-relocate=\"true\" attribute on the <script> which is mandatory for almost all scripts, mostly because their dependencies (such as jQuery) are moved to the bottom anyway. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 < script data-relocate = \"true\" > $ ( function () { // Code that uses jQuery (Legacy API) }); </ script > <!-- or --> < script data-relocate = \"true\" > require ([ \"Some\" , \"Dependencies\" ], function ( Some , Dependencies ) { // Modern API }); </ script > Including External JavaScript Files # The AMD-Modules used in the new API are automatically recognized and lazy-loaded on demand, so unless you have a rather large and pre-compiled code-base, there is nothing else to worry about. Debug-Variants and Cache-Buster # Your JavaScript files may change over time and you would want the users' browsers to always load and use the latest version of your files. This can be achieved by appending the special LAST_UPDATE_TIME constant to your file path. It contains the unix timestamp of the last time any package was installed, updated or removed and thus avoid outdated caches by relying on a unique value, without invalidating the cache more often that it needs to be. 1 < script data-relocate = \"true\" src = \"{$__wcf->getPath('app')}js/App.js?t={@LAST_UPDATE_TIME}\" ></ script > For small scripts you can simply serve the full, non-minified version to the user at all times, the differences in size and execution speed are insignificant and are very unlikely to offer any benefits. They might even yield a worse performance, because you'll have to include them statically in the template, even if the code is never called. However, if you're including a minified build in your app or plugin, you should include a switch to load the uncompressed version in the debug mode, while serving the minified and optimized file to the average visitor. You should use the ENABLE_DEBUG_MODE constant to decide which version should be loaded. 1 < script data-relocate = \"true\" src = \"{$__wcf->getPath('app')}js/App{if !ENABLE_DEBUG_MODE}.min{/if}.js?t={@LAST_UPDATE_TIME}\" ></ script > The Accelerated Guest View (\"Tiny Builds\") # You can learn more on the Accelerated Guest View in the migration docs. The \"Accelerated Guest View\" was introduced in WoltLab Suite 3.1 and aims to decrease page size and to improve responsiveness by enabling a read-only mode for visitors. If you are providing a separate compiled build for this mode, you'll need to include yet another switch to serve the right version to the visitor. 1 < script data-relocate = \"true\" src = \"{$__wcf->getPath('app')}js/App{if !ENABLE_DEBUG_MODE}{if VISITOR_USE_TINY_BUILD}.tiny{/if}.min{/if}.js?t={@LAST_UPDATE_TIME}\" ></ script > The {js} Template Plugin # The {js} template plugin exists solely to provide a much easier and less error-prone method to include external JavaScript files. 1 {js application='app' file='App' hasTiny=true} The hasTiny attribute is optional, you can set it to false or just omit it entirely if you do not provide a tiny build for your file.","title":"General Usage"},{"location":"javascript/general-usage/#general-javascript-usage","text":"WoltLab Suite 5.4 introduced support for TypeScript, migrating all existing modules to TypeScript.

The previously used API heavily relied on larger JavaScript files that contained a lot of different components with hidden dependencies and suffered from extensive jQuery usage for historic reasons. Eventually a new API was designed that solves the issues with the legacy API by following a few basic principles: 1. Vanilla ES5-JavaScript. It allows us to achieve the best performance across all platforms, there is simply no reason to use jQuery today and the performance penalty on mobile devices is a real issue. 2. Strict usage of modules. Each component is placed in an own file and all dependencies are explicitly declared and injected at the top.Eventually we settled with AMD-style modules using require.js which offers both lazy loading and \"ahead of time\"-compilatio with r.js . 3. No jQuery-based components on page init. Nothing is more annoying than loading a page and then wait for JavaScript to modify the page before it becomes usable, forcing the user to sit and wait. Heavily optimized vanilla JavaScript components offered the speed we wanted. 4. Limited backwards-compatibility.

This is accomplished by heavily restricting page interaction to read-only actions whenever possible, which in return removes the need to provide certain JavaScript modules in general. For example, disallowing guests to write any formatted messages will in return remove the need to provide the WYSIWYG editor at all. But it doesn't stop there, there are a lot of other modules that provide additional features for the editor, and by excluding the editor, we can also exclude these modules too. Long story short, the tiny mode guarantees that certain actions will never be carried out by guests or search engines, therefore some modules are not going to be needed by them ever. Code Templates for Tiny Builds # The following examples assume that you use the virtual constant COMPILER_TARGET_DEFAULT as a switch for the optimized code path. This is also the constant used by the official build scripts for JavaScript files . We recommend that you provide a mock implementation for existing code to ensure 3rd party compatibility. It is enough to provide a bare object or class that exposes the original properties using the same primitive data types. This is intended to provide a soft-fail for implementations that are not aware of the tiny mode yet, but is not required for classes that did not exist until now.

Real Error Messages for AJAX Responses # The errorMessage property in the returned response object for failed AJAX requests contained an exception-specific but still highly generic error message. This issue has been around for quite a long time and countless of implementations are relying on this false behavior, eventually forcing us to leave the value unchanged. This problem is solved by adding the new property realErrorMessage that exposes the message exactly as it was provided and now matches the value that would be displayed to users in traditional forms. Example Code # 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 define ([ 'Ajax' ], function ( Ajax ) { return { // ... _ajaxFailure : function ( responseData , responseText , xhr , requestData ) { console . log ( responseData . realErrorMessage ); } // ... }; }); Simplified Form Submit in Dialogs # Forms embedded in dialogs often do not contain the HTML <form> -element and instead rely on JavaScript click- and key-handlers to emulate a <form> -like submit behavior. This has spawned a great amount of nearly identical implementations that all aim to handle the form submit through the Enter -key, still leaving some dialogs behind. WoltLab Suite 3.1 offers automatic form submit that is enabled through a set of specific conditions and data attributes: There must be a submit button that matches the selector .formSubmit > input[type=\"submit\"], .formSubmit > button[data-type=\"submit\"] . The dialog object provided to UiDialog.open() implements the method _dialogSubmit() . Input fields require the attribute data-dialog-submit-on-enter=\"true\" to be set, the type must be one of number , password , search , tel , text or url . Clicking on the submit button or pressing the Enter -key in any watched input field will start the submit process. This is done automatically and does not require a manual interaction in your code, therefore you should not bind any click listeners on the submit button yourself. Any input field with the required attribute set will be validated to contain a non-empty string after processing the value with String.prototype.trim() . An empty field will abort the submit process and display a visible error message next to the offending field. Helper Function for Inline Error Messages # Displaying inline error messages on-the-fly required quite a few DOM operations that were quite simple but also super repetitive and thus error-prone when incorrectly copied over. The global helper function elInnerError() was added to provide a simple and consistent behavior of inline error messages. You can display an error message by invoking elInnerError(elementRef, \"Your Error Message\") , it will insert a new <small class=\"innerError\"> and sets the given message. If there is already an inner error present, then the message will be replaced instead. Hiding messages is done by setting the 2nd parameter to false or an empty string: elInnerError(elementRef, false) elInnerError(elementRef, '') The special values null and undefined are supported too, but their usage is discouraged, because they make it harder to understand the intention by reading the code: elInnerError(elementRef, null) elInnerError(elementRef) Example Code # 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 require ([ 'Language' ], function ( Language )) { var input = elBySel ( 'input[type=\"text\"]' ); if ( input . value . trim () === '' ) { // displays a new inline error or replaces the message if there is one already elInnerError ( input , Language . get ( 'wcf.global.form.error.empty' )); } else { // removes the inline error if it exists elInnerError ( input , false ); } // the above condition is equivalent to this: elInnerError ( input , ( input . value . trim () === '' ?

This has spawned a great amount of nearly identical implementations that all aim to handle the form submit through the Enter -key, still leaving some dialogs behind. WoltLab Suite 3.1 offers automatic form submit that is enabled through a set of specific conditions and data attributes: There must be a submit button that matches the selector .formSubmit > input[type=\"submit\"], .formSubmit > button[data-type=\"submit\"] . The dialog object provided to UiDialog.open() implements the method _dialogSubmit() . Input fields require the attribute data-dialog-submit-on-enter=\"true\" to be set, the type must be one of number , password , search , tel , text or url . Clicking on the submit button or pressing the Enter -key in any watched input field will start the submit process. This is done automatically and does not require a manual interaction in your code, therefore you should not bind any click listeners on the submit button yourself. Any input field with the required attribute set will be validated to contain a non-empty string after processing the value with String.prototype.trim() .

Instead, use click directly: 1 2 3 4 5 // before element . addEventListener ( WCF_CLICK_EVENT , this . _click . bind ( this )); // after element . addEventListener ( 'click' , ( ev ) => this . _click ( ev )); WCF.Action.Delete and WCF.Action.Toggle # WCF.Action.Delete and WCF.Action.Toggle were used for buttons to delete or enable/disable objects via JavaScript. In each template, WCF.Action.Delete or WCF.Action.Toggle instances had to be manually created for each object listing. With version 5.4 of WoltLab Suite, we have added a CSS selector-based global TypeScript module that only requires specific CSS classes to be added to the HTML structure for these buttons to work. Additionally, we have added a new {objectAction} template plugin, which generates these buttons reducing the amount of boilerplate template code. The required base HTML structure is as follows: A .jsObjectActionContainer element with a data-object-action-class-name attribute that contains the name of PHP class that executes the actions. .jsObjectActionObject elements within .jsObjectActionContainer that represent the objects for which actions can be executed. Each .jsObjectActionObject element must have a data-object-id attribute with the id of the object. .jsObjectAction elements within .jsObjectActionObject for each action with a data-object-action attribute with the name of the action. These elements can be generated with the {objectAction} template plugin for the delete and toggle action. Example: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 <table class=\"table jsObjectActionContainer\" { * * } data-object-action-class-name=\"wcf\\data\\foo\\FooAction\"> <thead> <tr> { * \u2026 * } </tr> </thead> <tbody> { foreach from = $objects item = foo } <tr class=\"jsObjectActionObject\" data-object-id=\" { $foo -> getObjectID () } \"> <td class=\"columnIcon\"> { objectAction action = \"toggle\" isDisabled = $foo -> isDisabled } { objectAction action = \"delete\" objectTitle = $foo -> getTitle () } { * \u2026 * } </td> { * \u2026 * } </tr> { /foreach } </tbody> </table> Please refer to the documentation in ObjectActionFunctionTemplatePlugin for details and examples on how to use this template plugin. The relevant TypeScript module registering the event listeners on the object action buttons is Ui/Object/Action . When an action button is clicked, an AJAX request is sent using the PHP class name and action name. After the successful execution of the action, the page is either reloaded if the action button has a data-object-action-success=\"reload\" attribute or an event using the EventHandler module is fired using WoltLabSuite/Core/Ui/Object/Action as the identifier and the object action name. Ui/Object/Action/Delete and Ui/Object/Action/Toggle listen to these events and update the user interface depending on the execute action by removing the object or updating the toggle button, respectively. Converting from WCF.Action.* to the new approach requires minimal changes per template, as shown in the relevant pull request #4080 . WCF.Table.EmptyTableHandler # When all objects in a table or list are deleted via their delete button or clipboard actions, an empty table or list can remain. Previously, WCF.Table.EmptyTableHandler had to be explicitly used in each template for these tables and lists to reload the page. As a TypeScript-based replacement for WCF.Table.EmptyTableHandler that is only initialized once globally, WoltLabSuite/Core/Ui/Empty was added. To use this new module, you only have to add the CSS class jsReloadPageWhenEmpty to the relevant HTML element. Once this HTML element no longer has child elements, the page is reloaded. To also cover scenarios in which there are fixed child elements that should not be considered when determining if there are no child elements, the data-reload-page-when-empty=\"ignore\" can be set for these elements.

With WoltLab Suite 5.4, we have added a general API that manages such rate limiting. Leveraging this API is easily done. Register an object type for the definition com.woltlab.wcf.floodControl : com.example.foo.myContent . Whenever the active user creates content of this type, call 1 FloodControl :: getInstance () -> registerContent ( 'com.example.foo.myContent' ); You should only call this method if the user creates the content themselves. If the content is automatically created by the system, for example when copying / duplicating existing content, no activity should be registered. To check the last time when the active user created content of the relevant type, use 1 FloodControl :: getInstance () -> getLastTime ( 'com.example.foo.myContent' ); If you want to limit the number of content items created within a certain period of time, for example within one day, use 1 2 3 4 5 $data = FloodControl :: getInstance () -> countContent ( 'com.example.foo.myContent' , new \\DateInterval ( 'P1D' )); // number of content items created within the last day $count = $data [ 'count' ]; // timestamp when the earliest content item was created within the last day $earliestTime = $data [ 'earliestTime' ]; The method also returns earliestTime so that you can tell the user in the error message when they are able again to create new content of the relevant type. Flood control entries are only stored for 31 days and older entries are cleaned up daily. The previously mentioned methods of FloodControl use the active user and the current timestamp as reference point. FloodControl also provides methods to register content or check flood control for other registered users or for guests via their IP address. For further details on these methods, please refer to the documentation in the FloodControl class . Do not interact directly with the flood control database table but only via the FloodControl class! DatabasePackageInstallationPlugin # DatabasePackageInstallationPlugin is a new idempotent package installation plugin (thus it is available in the sync function in the devtools) to update the database schema using the PHP-based database API. DatabasePackageInstallationPlugin is similar to ScriptPackageInstallationPlugin by requiring a PHP script that is included during the execution of the script. The script is expected to return an array of DatabaseTable objects representing the schema changes so that in contrast to using ScriptPackageInstallationPlugin , no DatabaseTableChangeProcessor object has to be created. The PHP file must be located in the acp/database/ directory for the devtools sync function to recognize the file. PHP Database API # The PHP API to add and change database tables during package installations and updates in the wcf\\system\\database\\table namespace now also supports renaming existing table columns with the new IDatabaseTableColumn::renameTo() method: 1 2 3 4 5 PartialDatabaseTable :: create ( 'wcf1_test' ) -> columns ([ NotNullInt10DatabaseTableColumn :: create ( 'oldName' ) -> renameTo ( 'newName' ) ]); Like with every change to existing database tables, packages can only rename columns that they installed. Captcha # The reCAPTCHA v1 implementation was completely removed. This includes the \\wcf\\system\\recaptcha\\RecaptchaHandler class (not to be confused with the one in the captcha namespace). The reCAPTCHA v1 endpoints have already been turned off by Google and always return a HTTP 404. Thus the implementation was completely non-functional even before this change. See WoltLab/WCF#3781 for details. Search # The generic implementation in the AbstractSearchEngine::parseSearchQuery() method was dangerous, because it did not have knowledge about the search engine\u2019s specifics. The implementation was completely removed: AbstractSearchEngine::parseSearchQuery() now always throws a \\BadMethodCallException . If you implemented a custom search engine and relied on this method, you can inline the previous implementation to preserve existing behavior. You should take the time to verify the rewritten queries against the manual of the search engine to make sure it cannot generate malformed queries or security issues. See WoltLab/WCF#3815 for details. Styles # The StyleCompiler class is marked final now. The internal SCSS compiler object being stored in the $compiler property was a design issue that leaked compiler state across multiple compiled styles, possibly causing misgenerated stylesheets. As the removal of the $compiler property effectively broke compatibility within the StyleCompiler and as the StyleCompiler never was meant to be extended, it was marked final. See WoltLab/WCF#3929 for details. Tags # Use of the wcf1_tag_to_object.languageID column is deprecated. The languageID column is redundant, because its value can be derived from the tagID . With WoltLab Suite 5.4, it will no longer be part of any indices, allowing more efficient index usage in the general case. If you need to filter the contents of wcf1_tag_to_object by language, you should perform an INNER JOIN wcf1_tag tag ON tag.tagID = tag_to_object.tagID and filter on wcf1_tag.languageID . See WoltLab/WCF#3904 for details. Avatars # The ISafeFormatAvatar interface was added to properly support fallback image types for use in emails. If your custom IUserAvatar implementation supports image types without broad support (i.e. anything other than PNG, JPEG, and GIF), then you should implement the ISafeFormatAvatar interface to return a fallback PNG, JPEG, or GIF image.

To improve the user interface when setting up the value of such options, we have added the lineBreakSeparatedText option type as a drop-in replacement where the individual items are explicitly represented as distinct items in the user interface. Ignoring of Users # WoltLab Suite 5.4 distinguishes between blocking direct contact only and hiding all contents when ignoring users. To allow for detecting the difference, the UserProfile::getIgnoredUsers() and UserProfile::isIgnoredUser() methods received a new $type parameter.

As long as you only interact with sessions via WCF::getSession() , especially when you perform read-only accesses, you should not notice any breaking changes. You might appreciate some of the new session methods if you process security sensitive data. Summary and Concepts # Most of the changes revolve around the removal of the legacy persistent login functionality and the assumption that every user has a single session only. Both aspects are related to each other. Legacy Persistent Login # The legacy persistent login was rather an automated login. Upon bootstrapping a session, it was checked whether the user had a cookie pair storing the user\u2019s userID and (a single BCrypt hash of) the user\u2019s password. If such a cookie pair exists and the BCrypt hash within the cookie matches the user\u2019s password hash when hashed again, the session would immediately changeUser() to the respective user. This legacy persistent login was completely removed. Instead, any sessions that belong to an authenticated user will automatically be long-lived. These long-lived sessions expire no sooner than 14 days after the last activity, ensuring that the user continously stays logged in, provided that they visit the page at least once per fortnight. Multiple Sessions # To allow for a proper separation of these long-lived user sessions, WoltLab Suite now allows for multiple sessions per user. These sessions are completely unrelated to each other. Specifically, they do not share session variables and they expire independently. As the existing wcf1_session table is also used for the online lists and location tracking, it will be maintained on a best effort basis. It no longer stores any private session data. The actual sessions storing security sensitive information are in an unrelated location. They must only be accessed via the PHP API exposed by the SessionHandler . Merged ACP and Frontend Sessions # WoltLab Suite 5.4 shares a single session across both the frontend, as well as the ACP. When a user logs in to the frontend, they will also be logged into the ACP and vice versa. Actual access to the ACP is controlled via the new reauthentication mechanism . The session variable store is scoped: Session variables set within the frontend are not available within the ACP and vice versa. Improved Authentication and Reauthentication # WoltLab Suite 5.4 ships with multi-factor authentication support and a generic re-authentication implementation that can be used to verify the account owner\u2019s presence. Additions and Changes # Password Hashing # WoltLab Suite 5.4 includes a new object-oriented password hashing framework that is modeled after PHP\u2019s password_* API. Check PasswordAlgorithmManager and IPasswordAlgorithm for details. The new default password hash is a standard BCrypt hash. All newly generated hashes in wcf1_user.password will now include a type prefix, instead of just passwords imported from other systems. Session Storage # The wcf1_session table will no longer be used for session storage. Instead, it is maintained for compatibility with existing online lists. The actual session storage is considered an implementation detail and you must not directly interact with the session tables. Future versions might support alternative session backends, such as Redis. Do not interact directly with the session database tables but only via the SessionHandler class! Reauthentication # For security sensitive processing, you might want to ensure that the account owner is actually present instead of a third party accessing a session that was accidentally left logged in. WoltLab Suite 5.4 ships with a generic reauthentication framework. To request reauthentication within your controller you need to: Use the wcf\\system\\user\\authentication\\TReauthenticationCheck trait. Call: 1 2 3 $this -> requestReauthentication ( LinkHandler :: getInstance () -> getControllerLink ( static :: class , [ /* additional parameters */ ])); requestReauthentication() will check if the user has recently authenticated themselves. If they did, the request proceeds as usual. Otherwise, they will be asked to reauthenticate themselves. After the successful authentication, they will be redirected to the URL that was passed as the first parameter (the current controller within the example). Details can be found in WoltLab/WCF#3775 . Multi-factor Authentication # To implement multi-factor authentication securely, WoltLab Suite 5.4 implements the concept of a \u201cpending user change\u201d. The user will not be logged in (i.e. WCF::getUser()->userID returns null ) until they authenticate themselves with their second factor. Requesting multi-factor authentication is done on an opt-in basis for compatibility reasons. If you perform authentication yourself and do not trust the authentication source to perform multi-factor authentication itself, you will need to adjust your logic to request multi-factor authentication from WoltLab Suite: Previously: 1 WCF :: getSession () -> changeUser ( $targetUser ); Now: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 $isPending = WCF :: getSession () -> changeUserAfterMultifactorAuthentication ( $targetUser ); if ( $isPending ) { // Redirect to the authentication form. The user will not be logged in. // Note: Do not use `getControllerLink` to support both the frontend as well as the ACP. HeaderUtil :: redirect ( LinkHandler :: getInstance () -> getLink ( 'MultifactorAuthentication' , [ 'url' => /* Return To */ , ])); exit ; } // Proceed as usual. The user will be logged in. Adding Multi-factor Methods # Adding your own multi-factor method requires the implementation of a single object type: objectType.xml 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 <type> <name> com.example.multifactor.foobar </name> <definitionname> com.woltlab.wcf.multifactor </definitionname> <icon> <!-- Font Awesome 4 Icon Name goes here. --> </icon> <priority> <!-- Determines the sort order, higher priority will be preferred for authentication. --> </priority> <classname> wcf\\system\\user\\multifactor\\FoobarMultifactorMethod </classname> </type> The given classname must implement the IMultifactorMethod interface. As a self-contained example, you can find the initial implementation of the email multi-factor method in WoltLab/WCF#3729 . Please check the version history of the PHP class to make sure you do not miss important changes that were added later. Multi-factor authentication is security sensitive. Make sure to carefully read the remarks in IMultifactorMethod for possible issues. Also make sure to carefully test your implementation against all sorts of incorrect input and consider attack vectors such as race conditions. It is strongly recommended to generously check the current state by leveraging assertions and exceptions. Enforcing Multi-factor Authentication # To enforce Multi-factor Authentication within your controller you need to: Use the wcf\\system\\user\\multifactor\\TMultifactorRequirementEnforcer trait. Call: $this->enforceMultifactorAuthentication(); enforceMultifactorAuthentication() will check if the user is in a group that requires multi-factor authentication, but does not yet have multi-factor authentication enabled. If they did, the request proceeds as usual. Otherwise, a NamedUserException is thrown. Deprecations and Removals # SessionHandler # Most of the changes with regard to the new session handling happened in SessionHandler . Most notably, SessionHandler now is marked final to ensure proper encapsulation of data. A number of methods in SessionHandler are now deprecated and result in a noop. This change mostly affects methods that have been used to bootstrap the session, such as setHasValidCookie() . Additionally, accessing the following keys on the session is deprecated. They directly map to an existing method in another class and any uses can easily be updated: - ipAddress - userAgent - requestURI - requestMethod - lastActivityTime Refer to the implementation for details. ACP Sessions # The database tables related to ACP sessions have been removed. The PHP classes have been preserved due to being used within the class hierarchy of the legacy sessions. Cookies # The _userID , _password , _cookieHash and _cookieHash_acp cookies will no longer be created nor consumed. Virtual Sessions # The virtual session logic existed to support multiple devices per single session in wcf1_session . Virtual sessions are no longer required with the refactored session handling. Anything related to virtual sessions has been completely removed as they are considered an implementation detail. This removal includes PHP classes and database tables. Security Token Constants # The security token constants are deprecated. Instead, the methods of SessionHandler should be used (e.g. ->getSecurityToken() ). Within templates, you should migrate to the {csrfToken} tag in place of {@SECURITY_TOKEN_INPUT_TAG} . The {csrfToken} tag is a drop-in replacement and was backported to WoltLab Suite 5.2+, allowing you to maintain compatibility across a broad range of versions.

Instead of using API versions packages should exclude version 6.0.0 Alpha 1 of com.woltlab.wcf going forward. WoltLab Suite 3.1 introduced a new versioning system that focused around the API compatibility and is intended to replace the <excludedpackage> instruction for the Core for most plugins. The <compatibility> -tag holds a list of compatible API versions, and while only a single version is available at the time of writing, future versions will add more versions with backwards-compatibility in mind. Example: 1 2 3 <compatibility> <api version= \"2018\" /> </compatibility> Existing API versions # WoltLab Suite Core API-Version Backwards-Compatible to API-Version 3.1 2018 n/a <instructions> # List of instructions to be executed upon install or update. The order is important, the topmost <instruction> will be executed first. <instructions type=\"install\"> # List of instructions for a new installation of this package. <instructions type=\"update\" fromversion=\"\u2026\"> # The attribute fromversion must be a valid version number as described in the \\<version> section and specifies a possible update from that very version to the package's version. The installation process will pick exactly one update instruction, ignoring everything else. Please read the explanation below! Example: Installed version: 1.0.0 Package version: 1.0.2 1 2 3 4 5 6 <instructions type= \"update\" fromversion= \"1.0.0\" > <!-- \u2026 --> </instructions> <instructions type= \"update\" fromversion= \"1.0.1\" > <!-- \u2026 --> </instructions> In this example WoltLab Suite Core will pick the first update block since it allows an update from 1.0.0 -> 1.0.2 . The other block is not considered, since the currently installed version is 1.0.0 . After applying the update block ( fromversion=\"1.0.0\" ), the version now reads 1.0.2 . <instruction> # Example: 1 <instruction type= \"objectTypeDefinition\" > objectTypeDefinition.xml </instruction> The attribute type specifies the instruction type which is used to determine the package installation plugin (PIP) invoked to handle its value. The value must be a valid file relative to the location of package.xml . Many PIPs provide default file names which are used if no value is given: 1 <instruction type= \"objectTypeDefinition\" /> There is a list of all default PIPs available. Both the type -attribute and the element value are case-sensitive. Windows does not care if the file is called objecttypedefinition.xml but was referenced as objectTypeDefinition.xml , but both Linux and Mac systems will be unable to find the file. In addition to the type attribute, an optional run attribute (with standalone as the only valid value) is supported which forces the installation to execute this PIP in an isolated request, allowing a single, resource-heavy PIP to execute without encountering restrictions such as PHP\u2019s memory_limit or max_execution_time : 1 <instruction type= \"file\" run= \"standalone\" /> <void/> # Sometimes a package update should only adjust the metadata of the package, for example, an optional package was added. However, WoltLab Suite Core requires that the list of <instructions> is non-empty. Instead of using a dummy <instruction> that idempotently updates some PIP, the <void/> tag can be used for this use-case. Using the <void/> tag is only valid for <instructions type=\"update\"> and must not be accompanied by other <instruction> tags.

Unlike plugins that extend an existing functionality and pages, apps have their own frontend with a dedicated namespace, database table prefixes and template locations. However, apps are meant to be a logical (and to some extent physical) separation from other parts of the framework, including other installed apps. They offer an additional layer of isolation and enable you to re-use class and template names that are already in use by the Core itself. If you've come here, thinking about the question if your next package should be an app instead of a regular plugin, the result is almost always: No. Differences to Plugins # Apps do offer a couple of unique features that are not available to plugins and there are valid reasons to use one instead of a plugin, but they also increase both the code and system complexity. There is a performance penalty for each installed app, regardless if it is actively used in a request or not, simplying being there forces the Core to include it in many places, for example, class resolution or even simple tasks such as constructing a link. Unique Namespace # Each app has its own unique namespace that is entirely separated from the Core and any other installed apps. The namespace is derived from the last part of the package identifier, for example, com.example.foo will yield the namespace foo . The namespace is always relative to the installation directory of the app, it doesn't matter if the app is installed on example.com/foo/ or in example.com/bar/ , the namespace will always resolve to the right directory. This app namespace is also used for ACP templates, frontend templates and files: 1 2 <!-- somewhere in the package.xml --> <instructions type= \"file\" application= \"foo\" /> Unique Database Table Prefix # All database tables make use of a generic prefix that is derived from one of the installed apps, including wcf which resolves to the Core itself. Following the aforementioned example, the new prefix fooN_ will be automatically registered and recognized in any generated statement. Any DatabaseObject that uses the app's namespace is automatically assumed to use the app's database prefix. For instance, foo\\data\\bar\\Bar is implicitly mapped to the database table fooN_bar . The app prefix is recognized in SQL-PIPs and statements that reference one of its database tables are automatically rewritten to use the Core's instance number. Separate Domain and Path Configuration # Any controller that is provided by a plugin is served from the configured domain and path of the corresponding app, such as plugins for the Core are always served from the Core's directory.

Parentheses may only be used around the condition and not around the whole statement: 1 2 3 4 <? php // do not do it like this $name = ( isset ( $tagArgs [ 'name' ]) ? $tagArgs [ 'name' ] : 'default' ); Parentheses around the conditions may not be used to wrap simple function calls: 1 2 3 4 <? php // do not do it like this $name = ( isset ( $tagArgs [ 'name' ])) ? $tagArgs [ 'name' ] : 'default' ; but have to be used for comparisons or other binary operators: 1 2 3 <? php $value = ( $otherValue > $upperLimit ) ? $additionalValue : $otherValue ; If you need to use more than one binary operator, use an if-else statement. The same rules apply to assigning array values: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 <? php $values = [ 'first' => $firstValue , 'second' => $secondToggle ? $secondValueA : $secondValueB , 'third' => ( $thirdToogle > 13 ) ? $thirdToogleA : $thirdToogleB ]; or return values: 1 2 3 <? php return isset ( $tagArgs [ 'name' ]) ? $tagArgs [ 'name' ] : 'default' ; Whitespaces # You have to put a whitespace in front of the following things: equal sign in assignments: $x = 1; comparison operators: $x == 1 opening bracket of a block public function test() { You have to put a whitespace behind the following things: equal sign in assignments: $x = 1; comparison operators: $x == 1 comma in a function/method parameter list if the comma is not followed by a line break: public function test($a, $b) { if , for , foreach , while : if ($x == 1) Classes # Referencing Class Names # If you have to reference a class name inside a php file, you have to use the class keyword. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 <? php // not like this $className = 'wcf\\data\\example\\Example' ; // like this use wcf\\data\\example\\Example ; $className = Example :: class ; Static Getters (of DatabaseObject Classes) # Some database objects provide static getters, either if they are decorators or for a unique combination of database table columns, like wcf\\data\\box\\Box::getBoxByIdentifier() : files/lib/data/box/Box.class.php 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 <? php namespace wcf\\data\\box ; use wcf\\data\\DatabaseObject ; use wcf\\system\\WCF ; class Box extends DatabaseObject { /** * Returns the box with the given identifier. * * @param string $identifier * @return Box|null */ public static function getBoxByIdentifier ( $identifier ) { $sql = \"SELECT * FROM wcf\" .

Therefore, this method should generally only be used for unique combinations.

Each database table is mapped to a model class that is designed to hold a single record from that table and expose methods to work with the stored data, for example providing assistance when working with normalized datasets. Developers are required to provide the proper DatabaseObject implementations themselves, they're not automatically generated, all though the actual code that needs to be written is rather small. The following examples assume the fictional database table wcf1_example , exampleID as the auto-incrementing primary key and the column bar to store some text. DatabaseObject # The basic model derives from wcf\\data\\DatabaseObject and provides a convenient constructor to fetch a single row or construct an instance using pre-loaded rows. files/lib/data/example/Example.class.php 1 2 3 4 5 <? php namespace wcf\\data\\example ; use wcf\\data\\DatabaseObject ; class Example extends DatabaseObject {} The class is intended to be empty by default and there only needs to be code if you want to add additional logic to your model.

The example above uses the namespace wcf\\\u2026 which is used as table prefix and the class name Example is converted into exampleID , resulting in the database table name wcfN_example with the primary key exampleID . You can prevent this automatic guessing by setting the class properties $databaseTableName and $databaseTableIndexName manually. DatabaseObjectDecorator # If you already have a DatabaseObject class and would like to extend it with additional data or methods, for example by providing a class ViewableExample which features view-related changes without polluting the original object, you can use DatabaseObjectDecorator which a default implementation of a decorator for database objects. files/lib/data/example/ViewableExample.class.php 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 <? php namespace wcf\\data\\example ; use wcf\\data\\DatabaseObjectDecorator ; class ViewableExample extends DatabaseObjectDecorator { protected static $baseClass = Example :: class ; public function getOutput () { $output = '' ; // [determine output] return $output ; } } It is mandatory to set the static $baseClass property to the name of the decorated class. Like for any decorator, you can directly access the decorated object's properties and methods for a decorated object by accessing the property or calling the method on the decorated object. You can access the decorated objects directly via DatabaseObjectDecorator::getDecoratedObject() . DatabaseObjectEditor # This is the low-level interface to manipulate data rows, it is recommended to use AbstractDatabaseObjectAction .

All rows will be fetched using a single query and the resulting rows are automatically loaded into separate models. files/lib/data/example/ExampleList.class.php 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 <? php namespace wcf\\data\\example ; use wcf\\data\\DatabaseObjectList ; class ExampleList extends DatabaseObjectList { public $className = Example :: class ; } The following code listing illustrates loading a large set of examples and iterating over the list to retrieve the objects. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 <? php $exampleList = new \\wcf\\data\\example\\ExampleList (); // add constraints using the condition builder $exampleList -> getConditionBuilder () -> add ( 'bar IN (?)' , [[ 'Hello World!' , 'bar' , 'baz' ]]); // actually read the rows $exampleList -> readObjects (); foreach ( $exampleList as $example ) { echo $example -> bar ; } // retrieve the models directly instead of iterating over them $examples = $exampleList -> getObjects (); // just retrieve the number of rows $exampleCount = $exampleList -> countObjects (); DatabaseObjectList implements both SeekableIterator and Countable . Additionally, DatabaseObjectList objects has the following three public properties that are useful when fetching data with lists: $sqlLimit determines how many rows are fetched. If its value is 0 (which is the default value), all results are fetched. So be careful when dealing with large tables and you only want a limited number of rows: Set $sqlLimit to a value larger than zero! $sqlOffset : Paginated pages like a thread list use this feature a lot, it allows you to skip a given number of results. Imagine you want to display 20 threads per page but there are a total of 60 threads available. In this case you would specify $sqlLimit = 20 and $sqlOffset = 20 which will skip the first 20 threads, effectively displaying thread 21 to 40. $sqlOrderBy determines by which column(s) the rows are sorted in which order. Using our example in $sqlOffset you might want to display the 20 most recent threads on page 1, thus you should specify the order field and its direction, e.g. $sqlOrderBy = 'thread.lastPostTime DESC' which returns the most recent thread first. For more advanced usage, there two additional fields that deal with the type of objects returned. First, let's go into a bit more detail what setting the $className property actually does: It is the type of database object in which the rows are wrapped. It determines which database table is actually queried and which index is used (see the $databaseTableName and $databaseTableIndexName properties of DatabaseObject ). Sometimes you might use the database table of some database object but wrap the rows in another database object. This can be achieved by setting the $objectClassName property to the desired class name. In other cases, you might want to wrap the created objects in a database object decorator which can be done by setting the $decoratorClassName property to the desired class name: 1 2 3 <? php $exampleList = new \\wcf\\data\\example\\ExampleList (); $exampleList -> decoratorClassName = \\wcf\\data\\example\\ViewableExample :: class ; Of course, you do not have to set the property after creating the list object, you can also set it by creating a dedicated class: files/lib/data/example/ViewableExampleList.class.php 1 2 3 4 5 6 <? php namespace wcf\\data\\example ; class ViewableExampleList extends ExampleList { public $decoratorClassName = ViewableExample :: class ; } AbstractDatabaseObjectAction # Row creation and manipulation can be performed using the aforementioned DatabaseObjectEditor class, but this approach has two major issues: Row creation, update and deletion takes place silently without notifying any other components. Data is passed to the database adapter without any further processing. The AbstractDatabaseObjectAction solves both problems by wrapping around the editor class and thus provide an additional layer between the action that should be taken and the actual process. The first problem is solved by a fixed set of events being fired, the second issue is addressed by having a single entry point for all data editing. files/lib/data/example/ExampleAction.class.php 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 <? php namespace wcf\\data\\example ; use wcf\\data\\AbstractDatabaseObjectAction ; class ExampleAction extends AbstractDatabaseObjectAction { public $className = ExampleEditor :: class ; } Executing an Action # The method AbstractDatabaseObjectAction::validateAction() is internally used for AJAX method invocation and must not be called programmatically.

Usually, this involves a strong opinion about the total number of SQL queries on a page, including but not limited to some magic treshold numbers, which should not be exceeded for \"performance reasons\". This misconception can easily lead into thinking that SQL queries should be avoided or at least written to a cache, so that it doesn't need to be executed so often. Unfortunately, this completely ignores the fact that both a single query can take down your app (e. g. full table scan on millions of rows), but 10 queries using a primary key on a table with a few hundred rows will not slow down your page. There are some queries that should go into caches by design, but most of the cache builders weren't initially there, but instead have been added because they were required to reduce the load significantly . You need to understand that caches always come at a cost, even a runtime cache does! In particular, they will always consume memory that is not released over the duration of the request lifecycle and potentially even leak memory by holding references to objects and data structures that are no longer required. Caching should always be a solution for a problem. When to Use a Cache # It's difficult to provide a definite answer or checklist when to use a cache and why it is required at this point, because the answer is: It depends. The permission cache for user groups is a good example for a valid cache, where we can achieve significant performance improvement compared to processing this data on every request. Its caches are build for each permutation of user group memberships that are encountered for a page request. Building this data is an expensive process that involves both inheritance and specific rules in regards to when a value for a permission overrules another value. The added benefit of this cache is that one cache usually serves a large number of users with the same group memberships and by computing these permissions once, we can serve many different requests. Also, the permissions are rather static values that change very rarely and thus we can expect a very high cache lifetime before it gets rebuild. When not to Use a Cache # I remember, a few years ago, there was a plugin that displayed a user's character from an online video game. The character sheet not only included a list of basic statistics, but also displayed the items that this character was wearing and or holding at the time. The data for these items were downloaded in bulk from the game's vendor servers and stored in a persistent cache file that periodically gets renewed. There is nothing wrong with the idea of caching the data on your own server rather than requesting them everytime from the vendor's servers - not only because they imposed a limit on the number of requests per hour. Unfortunately, the character sheet had a sub-par performance and the users were upset by the significant loading times compared to literally every other page on the same server. The author of the plugin was working hard to resolve this issue and was evaluating all kind of methods to improve the page performance, including deep-diving into the realm of micro-optimizations to squeeze out every last bit of performance that is possible. The real problem was the cache file itself, it turns out that it was holding the data for several thousand items with a total file size of about 13 megabytes. It doesn't look that much at first glance, after all this isn't the '90s anymore, but unserializing a 13 megabyte array is really slow and looking up items in such a large array isn't exactly fast either. The solution was rather simple, the data that was fetched from the vendor's API was instead written into a separate database table. Next, the persistent cache was removed and the character sheet would now request the item data for that specific character straight from the database. Previously, the character sheet took several seconds to load and after the change it was done in a fraction of a second.

without having to change any of the original source code. At many locations throughout the PHP code of WoltLab Suite Core and mainly through inheritance also in the applications and plugins, so called events are fired which trigger registered event listeners that get access to the object firing the event (or at least the class name if the event has been fired in a static method). This page focuses on the technical aspects of events and event listeners, the eventListener package installation plugin page covers how you can actually register an event listener. A comprehensive list of all available events is provided here . Introductory Example # Let's start with a simple example to illustrate how the event system works. Consider this pre-existing class: files/lib/system/example/ExampleComponent.class.php 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 <? php namespace wcf\\system\\example ; use wcf\\system\\event\\EventHandler ; class ExampleComponent { public $var = 1 ; public function getVar () { EventHandler :: getInstance () -> fireAction ( $this , 'getVar' ); return $this -> var ; } } where an event with event name getVar is fired in the getVar() method. If you create an object of this class and call the getVar() method, the return value will be 1 , of course: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 <? php $example = new wcf\\system\\example\\ExampleComponent (); if ( $example -> getVar () == 1 ) { echo \"var is 1!\" ; } else if ( $example -> getVar () == 2 ) { echo \"var is 2!\" ; } else { echo \"No, var is neither 1 nor 2.\" ; } // output: var is 1! Now, consider that we have registered the following event listener to this event: files/lib/system/event/listener/ExampleEventListener.class.php 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 <? php namespace wcf\\system\\event\\listener ; class ExampleEventListener implements IParameterizedEventListener { public function execute ( $eventObj , $className , $eventName , array & $parameters ) { $eventObj -> var = 2 ; } } Whenever the event in the getVar() method is called, this method (of the same event listener object) is called. In this case, the value of the method's first parameter is the ExampleComponent object passed as the first argument of the EventHandler::fireAction() call in ExampleComponent::getVar() . As ExampleComponent::$var is a public property, the event listener code can change it and set it to 2 . If you now execute the example code from above again, the output will change from var is 1! to var is 2! because prior to returning the value, the event listener code changes the value from 1 to 2 . This introductory example illustrates how event listeners can change data in a non-intrusive way. Program flow can be changed, for example, by throwing a wcf\\system\\exception\\PermissionDeniedException if some additional constraint to access a page is not fulfilled. Listening to Events # In order to listen to events, you need to register the event listener and the event listener itself needs to implement the interface wcf\\system\\event\\listener\\IParameterizedEventListener which only contains the execute method (see example above). The first parameter $eventObj of the method contains the passed object where the event is fired or the name of the class in which the event is fired if it is fired from a static method. The second parameter $className always contains the name of the class where the event has been fired. The third parameter $eventName provides the name of the event within a class to uniquely identify the exact location in the class where the event has been fired. The last parameter $parameters is a reference to the array which contains additional data passed by the method firing the event. If no additional data is passed, $parameters is empty. Firing Events # If you write code and want plugins to have access at certain points, you can fire an event on your own. The only thing to do is to call the wcf\\system\\event\\EventHandler::fireAction($eventObj, $eventName, array &$parameters = []) method and pass the following parameters: $eventObj should be $this if you fire from an object context, otherwise pass the class name static::class . $eventName identifies the event within the class and generally has the same name as the method. In cases, were you might fire more than one event in a method, for example before and after a certain piece of code, you can use the prefixes before* and after* in your event names. $parameters is an optional array which allows you to pass additional data to the event listeners without having to make this data accessible via a property explicitly only created for this purpose. This additional data can either be just additional information for the event listeners about the context of the method call or allow the event listener to manipulate local data if the code, where the event has been fired, uses the passed data afterwards. Example: Using $parameters argument # Consider the following method which gets some text that the methods parses. files/lib/system/example/ExampleParser.class.php 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 <? php namespace wcf\\system\\example ; use wcf\\system\\event\\EventHandler ; class ExampleParser { public function parse ( $text ) { // [some parsing done by default] $parameters = [ 'text' => $text ]; EventHandler :: getInstance () -> fireAction ( $this , 'parse' , $parameters ); return $parameters [ 'text' ]; } } After the default parsing by the method itself, the author wants to enable plugins to do additional parsing and thus fires an event and passes the parsed text as an additional parameter. Then, a plugin can deliver the following event listener files/lib/system/event/listener/ExampleParserEventListener.class.php 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 <? php namespace wcf\\system\\event\\listener ; class ExampleParserEventListener implements IParameterizedEventListener { public function execute ( $eventObj , $className , $eventName , array & $parameters ) { $text = $parameters [ 'text' ]; // [some additional parsing which changes $text] $parameters [ 'text' ] = $text ; } } which can access the text via $parameters['text'] . This example can also be perfectly used to illustrate how to name multiple events in the same method. Let's assume that the author wants to enable plugins to change the text before and after the method does its own parsing and thus fires two events: files/lib/system/example/ExampleParser.class.php 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 <? php namespace wcf\\system\\example ; use wcf\\system\\event\\EventHandler ; class ExampleParser { public function parse ( $text ) { $parameters = [ 'text' => $text ]; EventHandler :: getInstance () -> fireAction ( $this , 'beforeParsing' , $parameters ); $text = $parameters [ 'text' ]; // [some parsing done by default] $parameters = [ 'text' => $text ]; EventHandler :: getInstance () -> fireAction ( $this , 'afterParsing' , $parameters ); return $parameters [ 'text' ]; } } Advanced Example: Additional Form Field # One common reason to use event listeners is to add an additional field to a pre-existing form (in combination with template listeners, which we will not cover here). We will assume that users are able to do both, create and edit the objects via this form. The points in the program flow of AbstractForm that are relevant here are: adding object (after the form has been submitted): reading the value of the field validating the read value saving the additional value after successful validation and resetting locally stored value or assigning the current value of the field to the template after unsuccessful validation editing object: on initial form request: reading the pre-existing value of the edited object assigning the field value to the template after the form has been submitted: reading the value of the field validating the read value saving the additional value after successful validation assigning the current value of the field to the template All of these cases can be covered the by following code in which we assume that wcf\\form\\ExampleAddForm is the form to create example objects and that wcf\\form\\ExampleEditForm extends wcf\\form\\ExampleAddForm and is used for editing existing example objects. files/lib/system/event/listener/ExampleAddFormListener.class.php 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 <? php namespace wcf\\system\\event\\listener ; use wcf\\form\\ExampleAddForm ; use wcf\\form\\ExampleEditForm ; use wcf\\system\\exception\\UserInputException ; use wcf\\system\\WCF ; class ExampleAddFormListener implements IParameterizedEventListener { protected $var = 0 ; public function execute ( $eventObj , $className , $eventName , array & $parameters ) { $this -> $eventName ( $eventObj ); } protected function assignVariables () { WCF :: getTPL () -> assign ( 'var' , $this -> var ); } protected function readData ( ExampleEditForm $eventObj ) { if ( empty ( $_POST )) { $this -> var = $eventObj -> example -> var ; } } protected function readFormParameters () { if ( isset ( $_POST [ 'var' ])) $this -> var = intval ( $_POST [ 'var' ]); } protected function save ( ExampleAddForm $eventObj ) { $eventObj -> additionalFields = array_merge ( $eventObj -> additionalFields , [ 'var' => $this -> var ]); } protected function saved () { $this -> var = 0 ; } protected function validate () { if ( $this -> var < 0 ) { throw new UserInputException ( 'var' , 'isNegative' ); } } } The execute method in this example just delegates the call to a method with the same name as the event so that this class mimics the structure of a form class itself. The form object is passed to the methods but is only given in the method signatures as a parameter here whenever the form object is actually used. Furthermore, the type-hinting of the parameter illustrates in which contexts the method is actually called which will become clear in the following discussion of the individual methods: assignVariables() is called for the add and the edit form and simply assigns the current value of the variable to the template. readData() reads the pre-existing value of $var if the form has not been submitted and thus is only relevant when editing objects which is illustrated by the explicit type-hint of ExampleEditForm . readFormParameters() reads the value for both, the add and the edit form. save() is, of course, also relevant in both cases but requires the form object to store the additional value in the wcf\\form\\AbstractForm::$additionalFields array which can be used if a var column has been added to the database table in which the example objects are stored. saved() is only called for the add form as it clears the internal value so that in the assignVariables() call, the default value will be assigned to the template to create an \"empty\" form. During edits, this current value is the actual value that should be shown. validate() also needs to be called in both cases as the input data always has to be validated. Lastly, the following XML file has to be used to register the event listeners (you can find more information about how to register event listeners on the eventListener package installation plugin page ): eventListener.xml 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <data xmlns= \"http://www.woltlab.com\" xmlns:xsi= \"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation= \"http://www.woltlab.com http://www.woltlab.com/XSD/2019/eventListener.xsd\" > <import> <eventlistener name= \"exampleAddInherited\" > <eventclassname> wcf\\form\\ExampleAddForm </eventclassname> <eventname> assignVariables,readFormParameters,save,validate </eventname> <listenerclassname> wcf\\system\\event\\listener\\ExampleAddFormListener </listenerclassname> <inherit> 1 </inherit> </eventlistener> <eventlistener name= \"exampleAdd\" > <eventclassname> wcf\\form\\ExampleAddForm </eventclassname> <eventname> saved </eventname> <listenerclassname> wcf\\system\\event\\listener\\ExampleAddFormListener </listenerclassname> </eventlistener> <eventlistener name= \"exampleEdit\" > <eventclassname> wcf\\form\\ExampleEditForm </eventclassname> <eventname> readData </eventname> <listenerclassname> wcf\\system\\event\\listener\\ExampleAddFormListener </listenerclassname> </eventlistener> </import> </data>","title":"Events"},{"location":"php/api/events/#events","text":"WoltLab Suite's event system allows manipulation of program flows and data without having to change any of the original source code.

A comprehensive list of all available events is provided here .","title":"Events"},{"location":"php/api/events/#introductory-example","text":"Let's start with a simple example to illustrate how the event system works. Consider this pre-existing class: files/lib/system/example/ExampleComponent.class.php 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 <? php namespace wcf\\system\\example ; use wcf\\system\\event\\EventHandler ; class ExampleComponent { public $var = 1 ; public function getVar () { EventHandler :: getInstance () -> fireAction ( $this , 'getVar' ); return $this -> var ; } } where an event with event name getVar is fired in the getVar() method. If you create an object of this class and call the getVar() method, the return value will be 1 , of course: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 <? php $example = new wcf\\system\\example\\ExampleComponent (); if ( $example -> getVar () == 1 ) { echo \"var is 1!\" ; } else if ( $example -> getVar () == 2 ) { echo \"var is 2!\" ; } else { echo \"No, var is neither 1 nor 2.\" ; } // output: var is 1! Now, consider that we have registered the following event listener to this event: files/lib/system/event/listener/ExampleEventListener.class.php 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 <? php namespace wcf\\system\\event\\listener ; class ExampleEventListener implements IParameterizedEventListener { public function execute ( $eventObj , $className , $eventName , array & $parameters ) { $eventObj -> var = 2 ; } } Whenever the event in the getVar() method is called, this method (of the same event listener object) is called. In this case, the value of the method's first parameter is the ExampleComponent object passed as the first argument of the EventHandler::fireAction() call in ExampleComponent::getVar() . As ExampleComponent::$var is a public property, the event listener code can change it and set it to 2 . If you now execute the example code from above again, the output will change from var is 1! to var is 2! because prior to returning the value, the event listener code changes the value from 1 to 2 . This introductory example illustrates how event listeners can change data in a non-intrusive way. Program flow can be changed, for example, by throwing a wcf\\system\\exception\\PermissionDeniedException if some additional constraint to access a page is not fulfilled.","title":"Introductory Example"},{"location":"php/api/events/#listening-to-events","text":"In order to listen to events, you need to register the event listener and the event listener itself needs to implement the interface wcf\\system\\event\\listener\\IParameterizedEventListener which only contains the execute method (see example above). The first parameter $eventObj of the method contains the passed object where the event is fired or the name of the class in which the event is fired if it is fired from a static method. The second parameter $className always contains the name of the class where the event has been fired. The third parameter $eventName provides the name of the event within a class to uniquely identify the exact location in the class where the event has been fired.

In cases, were you might fire more than one event in a method, for example before and after a certain piece of code, you can use the prefixes before* and after* in your event names. $parameters is an optional array which allows you to pass additional data to the event listeners without having to make this data accessible via a property explicitly only created for this purpose.

Since version 3.1, WoltLab Suite Core is capable of automatically creating a sitemap. This sitemap contains all static pages registered via the page package installation plugin and which may be indexed by search engines (checking the allowSpidersToIndex parameter and page permissions) and do not expect an object ID. Other pages have to be added to the sitemap as a separate object. The only prerequisite for sitemap objects is that the objects are instances of wcf\\data\\DatabaseObject and that there is a wcf\\data\\DatabaseObjectList implementation. First, we implement the PHP class, which provides us all database objects and optionally checks the permissions for a single object. The class must implement the interface wcf\\system\\sitemap\\object\\ISitemapObjectObjectType . However, in order to have some methods already implemented and ensure backwards compatibility, you should use the abstract class wcf\\system\\sitemap\\object\\AbstractSitemapObjectObjectType . The abstract class takes care of generating the DatabaseObjectList class name and list directly and implements optional methods with the default values. The only method that you have to implement yourself is the getObjectClass() method which returns the fully qualified name of the DatabaseObject class. The DatabaseObject class must implement the interface wcf\\data\\ILinkableObject . Other optional methods are: The getLastModifiedColumn() method returns the name of the column in the database where the last modification date is stored. If there is none, this method must return null . The canView() method checks whether the passed DatabaseObject is visible to the current user with the current user always being a guest. The getObjectListClass() method returns a non-standard DatabaseObjectList class name. The getObjectList() method returns the DatabaseObjectList instance. You can, for example, specify additional query conditions in the method.

Since version 3.1, WoltLab Suite Core is capable of automatically creating a sitemap. This sitemap contains all static pages registered via the page package installation plugin and which may be indexed by search engines (checking the allowSpidersToIndex parameter and page permissions) and do not expect an object ID. Other pages have to be added to the sitemap as a separate object. The only prerequisite for sitemap objects is that the objects are instances of wcf\\data\\DatabaseObject and that there is a wcf\\data\\DatabaseObjectList implementation. First, we implement the PHP class, which provides us all database objects and optionally checks the permissions for a single object. The class must implement the interface wcf\\system\\sitemap\\object\\ISitemapObjectObjectType . However, in order to have some methods already implemented and ensure backwards compatibility, you should use the abstract class wcf\\system\\sitemap\\object\\AbstractSitemapObjectObjectType . The abstract class takes care of generating the DatabaseObjectList class name and list directly and implements optional methods with the default values. The only method that you have to implement yourself is the getObjectClass() method which returns the fully qualified name of the DatabaseObject class. The DatabaseObject class must implement the interface wcf\\data\\ILinkableObject . Other optional methods are: The getLastModifiedColumn() method returns the name of the column in the database where the last modification date is stored. If there is none, this method must return null . The canView() method checks whether the passed DatabaseObject is visible to the current user with the current user always being a guest. The getObjectListClass() method returns a non-standard DatabaseObjectList class name. The getObjectList() method returns the DatabaseObjectList instance. You can, for example, specify additional query conditions in the method.

Stacking of notification does not create new notifications for the same event for a certain object if the related action as been triggered by different users. For example, if something is liked by one user and then liked again by another user before the recipient of the notification has confirmed it, the existing notification will be amended to include both users who liked the content. Stacking can thus be used to avoid cluttering the notification list of users. The checkAccess() method makes sure that the active user still has access to the object related to the notification. If that is not the case, the user notification system will automatically deleted the user notification based on the return value of the method. If you have any cached values related to notifications, you should also reset these values here. The getEmailMessage() method return data to create the instant email or the daily summary email. For instant emails ( $notificationType = 'instant' ), you have to return an array like the one shown in the code above with the following components: application : abbreviation of application in-reply-to (optional): message id of the notification for the parent item and used to improve the ordering in threaded email clients message-id (optional): message id of the notification mail and has to be used in in-reply-to and references for follow up mails references (optional): all of the message ids of parent items (i.e. recursive in-reply-to) template : name of the template used to render the email body, should start with email_ variables (optional): template variables passed to the email template where they can be accessed via $notificationContent[variables] For daily emails ( $notificationType = 'daily' ), only application , template , and variables are supported. - The getEmailTitle() returns the title of the instant email sent to the user. By default, getEmailTitle() simply calls getTitle() . - The getEventHash() method returns a hash by which user notifications are grouped. Here, we want to group them not by the actual Foo object but by its parent Baz object and thus overwrite the default implementation provided by AbstractUserNotificationEvent . - The getLink() returns the link to the Foo object the notification belongs to. - The getMessage() method and the getTitle() return the message and the title of the user notification respectively. By checking the value of count($this->getAuthors()) , we check if the notification is stacked, thus if the event has been triggered for multiple users so that different languages items are used. If your notification event does not support stacking, this distinction is not necessary. - The prepare() method is called for each user notification before all user notifications are rendered. This allows to tell runtime caches to prepare to load objects later on (see Runtime Caches ).

Stacking of notification does not create new notifications for the same event for a certain object if the related action as been triggered by different users. For example, if something is liked by one user and then liked again by another user before the recipient of the notification has confirmed it, the existing notification will be amended to include both users who liked the content. Stacking can thus be used to avoid cluttering the notification list of users. The checkAccess() method makes sure that the active user still has access to the object related to the notification. If that is not the case, the user notification system will automatically deleted the user notification based on the return value of the method. If you have any cached values related to notifications, you should also reset these values here. The getEmailMessage() method return data to create the instant email or the daily summary email. For instant emails ( $notificationType = 'instant' ), you have to return an array like the one shown in the code above with the following components: application : abbreviation of application in-reply-to (optional): message id of the notification for the parent item and used to improve the ordering in threaded email clients message-id (optional): message id of the notification mail and has to be used in in-reply-to and references for follow up mails references (optional): all of the message ids of parent items (i.e. recursive in-reply-to) template : name of the template used to render the email body, should start with email_ variables (optional): template variables passed to the email template where they can be accessed via $notificationContent[variables] For daily emails ( $notificationType = 'daily' ), only application , template , and variables are supported. - The getEmailTitle() returns the title of the instant email sent to the user. By default, getEmailTitle() simply calls getTitle() . - The getEventHash() method returns a hash by which user notifications are grouped. Here, we want to group them not by the actual Foo object but by its parent Baz object and thus overwrite the default implementation provided by AbstractUserNotificationEvent . - The getLink() returns the link to the Foo object the notification belongs to. - The getMessage() method and the getTitle() return the message and the title of the user notification respectively. By checking the value of count($this->getAuthors()) , we check if the notification is stacked, thus if the event has been triggered for multiple users so that different languages items are used. If your notification event does not support stacking, this distinction is not necessary. - The prepare() method is called for each user notification before all user notifications are rendered. This allows to tell runtime caches to prepare to load objects later on (see Runtime Caches ).","title":"userNotificationEvent.xml"},{"location":"php/api/user_notifications/#firing-events","text":"When the action related to a user notification is executed, you can use UserNotificationHandler::fireEvent() to create the notifications: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 $recipientIDs = []; // fill with user ids of the recipients of the notification UserNotificationHandler :: getInstance () -> fireEvent ( 'bar' , // event name 'com.woltlab.example.foo' , // event object type name new FooUserNotificationObject ( new Foo ( $fooID )), // object related to the event $recipientIDs );","title":"Firing Events"},{"location":"php/api/user_notifications/#marking-notifications-as-confirmed","text":"In some instances, you might want to manually mark user notifications as confirmed without the user manually confirming them, for example when they visit the page that is related to the user notification.

An example is a text form field that should only be available if a certain option from a single selection form field is selected. Form builder\u2019s dependency system supports such scenarios and also automatically making form containers unavailable once all of its children are unavailable.

IFormFieldDependency # The basis of the dependencies is the IFormFieldDependency interface that has to be implemented by every dependency class.

EmptyFormFieldDependency is the inverse of NonEmptyFormFieldDependency , checking for !empty() . IsNotClickedFormFieldDependency is a special dependency for ButtonFormField s . Refer to the documentation of ButtomFormField for details. ValueFormFieldDependency can be used to ensure that a node is only shown if the value of the referenced form field is from a specified list of of values (see methods values($values) and getValues() ). Additionally, via negate($negate = true) and isNegated() , the logic can also be inverted by requiring the value of the referenced form field not to be from a specified list of values. JavaScript Implementation # To ensure that dependent node are correctly shown and hidden when changing the value of referenced form fields, every PHP dependency class has a corresponding JavaScript module that checks the dependency in the browser.

All of the JavaScript dependency objects automatically register themselves during initialization with the WoltLabSuite/Core/Form/Builder/Field/Dependency/Manager which takes care of checking the dependencies at the correct points in time. Additionally, the dependency manager also ensures that form containers in which all children are hidden due to dependencies are also hidden and, once any child becomes available again, makes the container also available again.

AbstractFormField # AbstractFormField is the abstract default implementation of the IFormField interface and it is expected that every implementation of IFormField implements the interface by extending this class. AbstractNumericFormField # AbstractNumericFormField is the abstract implementation of a form field handling a single numeric value. The class implements IAttributeFormField , IAutoCompleteFormField , ICssClassFormField , IImmutableFormField , IInputModeFormField , IMaximumFormField , IMinimumFormField , INullableFormField , IPlaceholderFormField and ISuffixedFormField . If the property $integerValues is true , the form field works with integer values, otherwise it works with floating point numbers. The methods step($step = null) and getStep() can be used to set and get the step attribute of the input element. The default step for form fields with integer values is 1 . Otherwise, the default step is any . AbstractFormFieldDecorator # Only available since version 5.4.5. AbstractFormFieldDecorator is a default implementation of a decorator for form fields that forwards calls to all methods defined in IFormField to the respective method of the decorated object. The class implements IFormfield . If the implementation of a more specific interface is required then the remaining methods must be implemented in the concrete decorator derived from AbstractFormFieldDecorator and the type of the $field property must be narrowed appropriately. General Form Fields # The following form fields are general reusable fields without any underlying context. BooleanFormField # BooleanFormField is used for boolean ( 0 or 1 , yes or no ) values. Objects of this class require a label. The return value of getSaveValue() is the integer representation of the boolean value, i.e. 0 or 1 . The class implements IAttributeFormField , IAutoFocusFormField , ICssClassFormField , and IImmutableFormField . CheckboxFormField # Only available since version 5.3.2. CheckboxFormField extends BooleanFormField and offers a simple HTML checkbox. ClassNameFormField # ClassNameFormField is a text form field that supports additional settings, specific to entering a PHP class name: classExists($classExists = true) and getClassExists() can be used to ensure that the entered class currently exists in the installation. By default, the existance of the entered class is required. implementedInterface($interface) and getImplementedInterface() can be used to ensure that the entered class implements the specified interface. By default, no interface is required. parentClass($parentClass) and getParentClass() can be used to ensure that the entered class extends the specified class. By default, no parent class is required. instantiable($instantiable = true) and isInstantiable() can be used to ensure that the entered class is instantiable. By default, entered classes have to instantiable. Additionally, the default id of a ClassNameFormField object is className , the default label is wcf.form.field.className , and if either an interface or a parent class is required, a default description is set if no description has already been set ( wcf.form.field.className.description.interface and wcf.form.field.className.description.parentClass , respectively). DateFormField # DateFormField is a form field to enter a date (and optionally a time). The class implements IAttributeFormField , IAutoFocusFormField , ICssClassFormField , IImmutableFormField , and INullableFormField . The following methods are specific to this form field class: earliestDate($earliestDate) and getEarliestDate() can be used to get and set the earliest selectable/valid date and latestDate($latestDate) and getLatestDate() can be used to get and set the latest selectable/valid date. The date passed to the setters must have the same format as set via saveValueFormat() . If a custom format is used, that format has to be set via saveValueFormat() before calling any of the setters. saveValueFormat($saveValueFormat) and getSaveValueFormat() can be used to specify the date format of the value returned by getSaveValue() . By default, U is used as format. The PHP manual provides an overview of supported formats. supportTime($supportsTime = true) and supportsTime() can be used to toggle whether, in addition to a date, a time can also be specified. By default, specifying a time is disabled. DescriptionFormField # DescriptionFormField is a multi-line text form field with description as the default id and wcf.global.description as the default label. EmailFormField # EmailFormField is a form field to enter an email address which is internally validated using UserUtil::isValidEmail() . The class implements IAttributeFormField , IAutoCompleteFormField , IAutoFocusFormField , ICssClassFormField , II18nFormField , IImmutableFormField , IInputModeFormField , IPatternFormField , and IPlaceholderFormField . FloatFormField # FloatFormField is an implementation of AbstractNumericFormField for floating point numbers. HiddenFormField # HiddenFormField is a form field without any user-visible UI. Even though the form field is invisible to the user, the value can still be modified by the user, e.g. by leveraging the web browsers developer tools. The HiddenFormField must not be used to transfer sensitive information or information that the user should not be able to modify. IconFormField # IconFormField is a form field to select a FontAwesome icon. IntegerFormField # IntegerFormField is an implementation of AbstractNumericFormField for integers. IsDisabledFormField # IsDisabledFormField is a boolean form field with isDisabled as the default id. ItemListFormField # ItemListFormField is a form field in which multiple values can be entered and returned in different formats as save value. The class implements IAttributeFormField , IAutoFocusFormField , ICssClassFormField , IImmutableFormField , and IMultipleFormField . The saveValueType($saveValueType) and getSaveValueType() methods are specific to this form field class and determine the format of the save value. The following save value types are supported: ItemListFormField::SAVE_VALUE_TYPE_ARRAY adds a custom data processor that writes the form field data directly in the parameters array and not in the data sub-array of the parameters array. ItemListFormField::SAVE_VALUE_TYPE_CSV lets the value be returned as a string in which the values are concatenated by commas. ItemListFormField::SAVE_VALUE_TYPE_NSV lets the value be returned as a string in which the values are concatenated by \\n . ItemListFormField::SAVE_VALUE_TYPE_SSV lets the value be returned as a string in which the values are concatenated by spaces. By default, ItemListFormField::SAVE_VALUE_TYPE_CSV is used. If ItemListFormField::SAVE_VALUE_TYPE_ARRAY is used as save value type, ItemListFormField objects register a custom form field data processor to add the relevant array into the $parameters array directly using the object property as the array key. MultilineTextFormField # MultilineTextFormField is a text form field that supports multiple rows of text. The methods rows($rows) and getRows() can be used to set and get the number of rows of the textarea elements. The default number of rows is 10 . These methods do not , however, restrict the number of text rows that can be entered. MultipleSelectionFormField # MultipleSelectionFormField is a form fields that allows the selection of multiple options out of a predefined list of available options. The class implements IAttributeFormField , ICssClassFormField , IFilterableSelectionFormField , IImmutableFormField , and INullableFormField . If the field is nullable and no option is selected, null is returned as the save value. RadioButtonFormField # RadioButtonFormField is a form fields that allows the selection of a single option out of a predefined list of available options using radiobuttons. The class implements IAttributeFormField , ICssClassFormField , IImmutableFormField , and ISelectionFormField . RatingFormField # RatingFormField is a form field to set a rating for an object. The class implements IImmutableFormField , IMaximumFormField , IMinimumFormField , and INullableFormField . Form fields of this class have rating as their default id, wcf.form.field.rating as their default label, 1 as their default minimum, and 5 as their default maximum. For this field, the minimum and maximum refer to the minimum and maximum rating an object can get. When the field is shown, there will be maximum() - minimum() + 1 icons be shown with additional CSS classes that can be set and gotten via defaultCssClasses(array $cssClasses) and getDefaultCssClasses() . If a rating values is set, the first getValue() icons will instead use the classes that can be set and gotten via activeCssClasses(array $cssClasses) and getActiveCssClasses() . By default, the only default class is fa-star-o and the active classes are fa-star and orange . ShowOrderFormField # ShowOrderFormField is a single selection form field for which the selected value determines the position at which an object is shown. The show order field provides a list of all siblings and the object will be positioned after the selected sibling. To insert objects at the very beginning, the options() automatically method prepends an additional option for that case so that only the existing siblings need to be passed. The default id of instances of this class is showOrder and their default label is wcf.form.field.showOrder . It is important that the relevant object property is always kept updated. Whenever a new object is added or an existing object is edited or delete, the values of the other objects have to be adjusted to ensure consecutive numbering. SingleSelectionFormField # SingleSelectionFormField is a form fields that allows the selection of a single option out of a predefined list of available options. The class implements ICssClassFormField , IFilterableSelectionFormField , IImmutableFormField , and INullableFormField . If the field is nullable and the current form field value is considered empty by PHP, null is returned as the save value. SortOrderFormField # SingleSelectionFormField is a single selection form field with default id sortOrder , default label wcf.global.showOrder and default options ASC: wcf.global.sortOrder.ascending and DESC: wcf.global.sortOrder.descending . TextFormField # TextFormField is a form field that allows entering a single line of text. The class implements IAttributeFormField , IAutoCompleteFormField , ICssClassFormField , IImmutableFormField , II18nFormField , IInputModeFormField , IMaximumLengthFormField , IMinimumLengthFormField , IPatternFormField , and IPlaceholderFormField . TitleFormField # TitleFormField is a text form field with title as the default id and wcf.global.title as the default label. UrlFormField # UrlFormField is a text form field whose values are checked via Url::is() . Specific Fields # The following form fields are reusable fields that generally are bound to a certain API or DatabaseObject implementation. AclFormField # AclFormField is used for setting up acl values for specific objects. The class implements IObjectTypeFormField and requires an object type of the object type definition com.woltlab.wcf.acl . Additionally, the class provides the methods categoryName($categoryName) and getCategoryName() that allow setting a specific name or filter for the acl option categories whose acl options are shown. A category name of null signals that no category filter is used. AclFormField objects register a custom form field data processor to add the relevant ACL object type id into the $parameters array directly using {$objectProperty}_aclObjectTypeID as the array key. The relevant database object action method is expected, based on the given ACL object type id, to save the ACL option values appropriately. ButtonFormField # Only available since version 5.4. ButtonFormField shows a submit button as part of the form. The class implements IAttributeFormField and ICssClassFormField . Specifically for this form field, there is the IsNotClickedFormFieldDependency dependency with which certain parts of the form will only be processed if the relevent button has not clicked.

As usernames have a system-wide restriction of a minimum length of 3 and a maximum length of 100 characters, these values are also used as the default value for the field\u2019s minimum and maximum length. Wysiwyg form container # To integrate a wysiwyg editor into a form, you have to create a WysiwygFormContainer object. This container takes care of creating all necessary form nodes listed below for a wysiwyg editor. When creating the container object, its id has to be the id of the form field that will manage the actual text. The following methods are specific to this form container class: addSettingsNode(IFormChildNode $settingsNode) and addSettingsNodes(array $settingsNodes) can be used to add nodes to the settings tab container. attachmentData($objectType, $parentObjectID) can be used to set the data relevant for attachment support. By default, not attachment data is set, thus attachments are not supported. getAttachmentField() , getPollContainer() , getSettingsContainer() , getSmiliesContainer() , and getWysiwygField() can be used to get the different components of the wysiwyg form container once the form has been built. enablePreviewButton($enablePreviewButton) can be used to set whether the preview button for the message is shown or not. By default, the preview button is shown. This method is only relevant before the form is built. Afterwards, the preview button availability can not be changed.

By default, the preselect is 'true' which is used to pre-select the first tab. messageObjectType($messageObjectType) can be used to set the message object type. pollObjectType($pollObjectType) can be used to set the poll object type. By default, no poll object type is set, thus the poll form field container is not available. supportMentions($supportMentions) can be used to set if mentions are supported. By default, mentions are not supported. This method is only relevant before the form is built. Afterwards, mention support can only be changed via the wysiwyg form field. supportSmilies($supportSmilies) can be used to set if smilies are supported. By default, smilies are supported. This method is only relevant before the form is built. Afterwards, smiley availability can only be changed via changing the availability of the smilies form container. WysiwygAttachmentFormField # WysiwygAttachmentFormField provides attachment support for a wysiwyg editor via a tab in the menu below the editor. This class should not be used directly but only via WysiwygFormContainer . The methods attachmentHandler(AttachmentHandler $attachmentHandler) and getAttachmentHandler() can be used to set and get the AttachmentHandler object that is used for uploaded attachments. WysiwygPollFormContainer # WysiwygPollFormContainer provides poll support for a wysiwyg editor via a tab in the menu below the editor. This class should not be used directly but only via WysiwygFormContainer . WysiwygPollFormContainer contains all form fields that are required to create polls and requires edited objects to implement IPollContainer . The following methods are specific to this form container class: getEndTimeField() returns the form field to set the end time of the poll once the form has been built. getIsChangeableField() returns the form field to set if poll votes can be changed once the form has been built. getIsPublicField() returns the form field to set if poll results are public once the form has been built. getMaxVotesField() returns the form field to set the maximum number of votes once the form has been built. getOptionsField() returns the form field to set the poll options once the form has been built. getQuestionField() returns the form field to set the poll question once the form has been built. getResultsRequireVoteField() returns the form field to set if viewing the poll results requires voting once the form has been built. getSortByVotesField() returns the form field to set if the results are sorted by votes once the form has been built. WysiwygSmileyFormContainer # WysiwygSmileyFormContainer provides smiley support for a wysiwyg editor via a tab in the menu below the editor. This class should not be used directly but only via WysiwygFormContainer . WysiwygSmileyFormContainer creates a sub-tab for each smiley category. WysiwygSmileyFormNode # WysiwygSmileyFormNode is contains the smilies of a specific category. This class should not be used directly but only via WysiwygSmileyFormContainer . Example # The following code creates a WYSIWYG editor component for a message object property. As smilies are supported by default and an attachment object type is given, the tab menu below the editor has two tabs: \u201cSmilies\u201d and \u201cAttachments\u201d. Additionally, mentions and quotes are supported. 1 2 3 4 5 6 WysiwygFormContainer :: create ( 'message' ) -> label ( 'foo.bar.message' ) -> messageObjectType ( 'com.example.foo.bar' ) -> attachmentData ( 'com.example.foo.bar' ) -> supportMentions () -> supportQuotes () WysiwygFormField # WysiwygFormField is used for wysiwyg editor form fields. This class should, in general, not be used directly but only via WysiwygFormContainer . The class implements IAttributeFormField , IMaximumLengthFormField , IMinimumLengthFormField , and IObjectTypeFormNode and requires an object type of the object type definition com.woltlab.wcf.message . The following methods are specific to this form field class: autosaveId($autosaveId) and getAutosaveId() can be used enable automatically saving the current editor contents in the browser using the given id. An empty string signals that autosaving is disabled. lastEditTime($lastEditTime) and getLastEditTime() can be used to set the last time the contents have been edited and saved so that the JavaScript can determine if the contents stored in the browser are older or newer. 0 signals that no last edit time has been set. supportAttachments($supportAttachments) and supportsAttachments() can be used to set and check if the form field supports attachments. It is not sufficient to simply signal attachment support via these methods for attachments to work. These methods are relevant internally to signal the Javascript code that the editor supports attachments. Actual attachment support is provided by WysiwygAttachmentFormField . supportMentions($supportMentions) and supportsMentions() can be used to set and check if the form field supports mentions of other users. WysiwygFormField objects register a custom form field data processor to add the relevant simple ACL data array into the $parameters array directly using the object property as the array key. TWysiwygFormNode # All form nodes that need to know the id of the WysiwygFormField field should use TWysiwygFormNode . This trait provides getWysiwygId() and wysiwygId($wysiwygId) to get and set the relevant wysiwyg editor id.

The migration guide for WoltLab Suite Core 5.2 provides some examples of how to migrate existing forms to form builder that can also help in understanding form builder if the old way of creating forms is familiar. Advantages of Form Builder # WoltLab Suite 5.2 introduces a new powerful way of creating forms: form builder. Before taking a closer look at form builder, let us recap how forms are created in previous versions: In general, for each form field, there is a corresponding property of the form's PHP class whose value has to be read from the request data, validated, and passed to the database object action to store the value in a database table. When editing an object, the property's value has to be set using the value of the corresponding property of the edited object. In the form's template, you have to write the <form> element with all of its children: the <section> elements, the <dl> elements, and, of course, the form fields themselves. In summary, this way of creating forms creates much duplicate or at least very similar code and makes it very time consuming if the structure of forms in general or a specific type of form field has to be changed. Form builder, in contrast, relies on PHP objects representing each component of the form, from the form itself down to each form field. This approach makes creating forms as easy as creating some PHP objects, populating them with all the relevant data, and one line of code in the template to print the form. Form Builder Components # Form builder consists of several components that are presented on the following pages: Structure of form builder Form validation and form data Form node dependencies In general, form builder provides default implementation of interfaces by providing either abstract classes or traits. It is expected that the interfaces are always implemented using these abstract classes and traits! This way, if new methods are added to the interfaces, default implementations can be provided by the abstract classes and traits without causing backwards compatibility problems. AbstractFormBuilderForm # To make using form builder easier, AbstractFormBuilderForm extends AbstractForm and provides most of the code needed to set up a form (of course without specific fields, those have to be added by the concrete form class), like reading and validating form values and using a database object action to use the form data to create or update a database object. In addition to the existing methods inherited by AbstractForm , AbstractFormBuilderForm provides the following methods: buildForm() builds the form in the following steps: Call AbtractFormBuilderForm::createForm() to create the IFormDocument object and add the form fields. Call IFormDocument::build() to build the form. Call AbtractFormBuilderForm::finalizeForm() to finalize the form like adding dependencies. Additionally, between steps 1 and 2 and after step 3, the method provides two events, createForm and buildForm to allow plugins to register event listeners to execute additional code at the right point in time. - createForm() creates the FormDocument object and sets the form mode. Classes extending AbstractFormBuilderForm have to override this method (and call parent::createForm() as the first line in the overridden method) to add concrete form containers and form fields to the bare form document. - finalizeForm() is called after the form has been built and the complete form hierarchy has been established. This method should be overridden to add dependencies, for example. - setFormAction() is called at the end of readData() and sets the form document\u2019s action based on the controller class name and whether an object is currently edited. - If an object is edited, at the beginning of readData() , setFormObjectData() is called which calls IFormDocument::loadValuesFromObject() . If values need to be loaded from additional sources, this method should be used for that. AbstractFormBuilderForm also provides the following (public) properties: $form contains the IFormDocument object created in createForm() . $formAction is either create (default) or edit and handles which method of the database object is called by default ( create is called for $formAction = 'create' and update is called for $formAction = 'edit' ) and is used to set the value of the action template variable. $formObject contains the IStorableObject if the form is used to edit an existing object. For forms used to create objects, $formObject is always null . Edit forms have to manually identify the edited object based on the request data and set the value of $formObject . $objectActionName can be used to set an alternative action to be executed by the database object action that deviates from the default action determined by the value of $formAction . $objectActionClass is the name of the database object action class that is used to create or update the database object. DialogFormDocument # Form builder forms can also be used in dialogs. For such forms, DialogFormDocument should be used which provides the additional methods cancelable($cancelable = true) and isCancelable() to set and check if the dialog can be canceled. If a dialog form can be canceled, a cancel button is added. If the dialog form is fetched via an AJAX request, IFormDocument::ajax() has to be called. AJAX forms are registered with WoltLabSuite/Core/Form/Builder/Manager which also supports getting all of the data of a form via the getData(formId) function. The getData() function relies on all form fields creating and registering a WoltLabSuite/Core/Form/Builder/Field/Field object that provides the data of a specific field. To make it as easy as possible to work with AJAX forms in dialogs, WoltLabSuite/Core/Form/Builder/Dialog (abbreviated as FormBuilderDialog from now on) should generally be used instead of WoltLabSuite/Core/Form/Builder/Manager directly. The constructor of FormBuilderDialog expects the following parameters: dialogId : id of the dialog element className : PHP class used to get the form dialog (and save the data if options.submitActionName is set) actionName : name of the action/method of className that returns the dialog; the method is expected to return an array with formId containg the id of the returned form and dialog containing the rendered form dialog options : additional options: actionParameters (default: empty): additional parameters sent during AJAX requests destroyOnClose (default: false ): if true , whenever the dialog is closed, the form is destroyed so that a new form is fetched if the dialog is opened again dialog : additional dialog options used as options during dialog setup onSubmit : callback when the form is submitted (takes precedence over submitActionName ) submitActionName (default: not set): name of the action/method of className called when the form is submitted The three public functions of FormBuilderDialog are: destroy() destroys the dialog, the form, and all of the form fields. getData() returns a Promise that returns the form data. open() opens the dialog. Example: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 require ([ 'WoltLabSuite/Core/Form/Builder/Dialog' ], function ( FormBuilderDialog ) { var dialog = new FormBuilderDialog ( 'testDialog' , 'wcf\\\\data\\\\test\\\\TestAction' , 'getDialog' , { destroyOnClose : true , dialog : { title : 'Test Dialog' }, submitActionName : 'saveDialog' } ); elById ( 'testDialogButton' ). addEventListener ( 'click' , function () { dialog . open (); }); });","title":"Overview"},{"location":"php/api/form_builder/overview/#form-builder","text":"Form builder is only available since WoltLab Suite Core 5.2.

The basis for all three elements are form nodes. The form builder API uses fluent interfaces heavily, meaning that unless a method is a getter, it generally returns the objects itself to support method chaining. Form Nodes # IFormNode is the base interface that any node of a form has to implement. IFormChildNode extends IFormNode for such elements of a form that can be a child node to a parent node. IFormParentNode extends IFormNode for such elements of a form that can be a parent to child nodes. IFormElement extends IFormNode for such elements of a form that can have a description and a label. IFormNode # IFormNode is the base interface that any node of a form has to implement and it requires the following methods: addClass($class) , addClasses(array $classes) , removeClass($class) , getClasses() , and hasClass($class) add, remove, get, and check for CSS classes of the HTML element representing the form node. If the form node consists of multiple (nested) HTML elements, the classes are generally added to the top element. static validateClass($class) is used to check if a given CSS class is valid. By default, a form node has no CSS classes. addDependency(IFormFieldDependency $dependency) , removeDependency($dependencyId) , getDependencies() , and hasDependency($dependencyId) add, remove, get, and check for dependencies of this form node on other form fields. checkDependencies() checks if all of the node\u2019s dependencies are met and returns a boolean value reflecting the check\u2019s result. The form builder dependency documentation provides more detailed information about dependencies and how they work. By default, a form node has no dependencies. attribute($name, $value = null) , removeAttribute($name) , getAttribute($name) , getAttributes() , hasAttribute($name) add, remove, get, and check for attributes of the HTML element represting the form node. The attributes are added to the same element that the CSS classes are added to. static validateAttribute($name) is used to check if a given attribute is valid. By default, a form node has no attributes. available($available = true) and isAvailable() can be used to set and check if the node is available. The availability functionality can be used to easily toggle form nodes based, for example, on options without having to create a condition to append the relevant. This way of checking availability makes it easier to set up forms. By default, every form node is available. The following aspects are important when working with availability: Unavailable fields produce no output, their value is not read, they are not validated and they are not checked for save values. Form fields are also able to mark themselves as unavailable, for example, a selection field without any options. Form containers are automatically unavailable if they contain no available children. Availability sets the static availability for form nodes that does not change during the lifetime of a form. In contrast, dependencies represent a dynamic availability for form nodes that depends on the current value of certain form fields. - cleanup() is called after the whole form is not used anymore to reset other APIs if the form fields depends on them and they expect such a reset. This method is not intended to clean up the form field\u2019s value as a new form document object is created to show a clean form. - getDocument() returns the IFormDocument object the node belongs to. (As IFormDocument extends IFormNode , form document objects simply return themselves.) - getHtml() returns the HTML representation of the node. getHtmlVariables() return template variables (in addition to the form node itself) to render the node\u2019s HTML representation. - id($id) and getId() set and get the id of the form node. Every id has to be unique within a form. getPrefixedId() returns the prefixed version of the node\u2019s id (see IFormDocument::getPrefix() and IFormDocument::prefix() ). static validateId($id) is used to check if a given id is valid. - populate() is called by IFormDocument::build() after all form nodes have been added. This method should finilize the initialization of the form node after all parent-child relations of the form document have been established. This method is needed because during the construction of a form node, it neither knows the form document it will belong to nor does it know its parent. - validate() checks, after the form is submitted, if the form node is valid. A form node with children is valid if all of its child nodes are valid. A form field is valid if its value is valid. - static create($id) is the factory method that has to be used to create new form nodes with the given id. TFormNode provides a default implementation of most of these methods. IFormChildNode # IFormChildNode extends IFormNode for such elements of a form that can be a child node to a parent node and it requires the parent(IFormParentNode $parentNode) and getParent() methods used to set and get the node\u2019s parent node. TFormChildNode provides a default implementation of these two methods and also of IFormNode::getDocument() . IFormParentNode # IFormParentNode extends IFormNode for such elements of a form that can be a parent to child nodes. Additionally, the interface also extends \\Countable and \\RecursiveIterator . The interface requires the following methods: appendChild(IFormChildNode $child) , appendChildren(array $children) , insertAfter(IFormChildNode $child, $referenceNodeId) , and insertBefore(IFormChildNode $child, $referenceNodeId) are used to insert new children either at the end or at specific positions. validateChild(IFormChildNode $child) is used to check if a given child node can be added. A child node cannot be added if it would cause an id to be used twice. children() returns the direct children of a form node. getIterator() return a recursive iterator for a form node. getNodeById($nodeId) returns the node with the given id by searching for it in the node\u2019s children and recursively in all of their children. contains($nodeId) can be used to simply check if a node with the given id exists. hasValidationErrors() checks if a form node or any of its children has a validation error (see IFormField::getValidationErrors() ). readValues() recursively calls IFormParentNode::readValues() and IFormField::readValue() on its children. IFormElement # IFormElement extends IFormNode for such elements of a form that can have a description and a label and it requires the following methods: label($languageItem = null, array $variables = []) and getLabel() can be used to set and get the label of the form element. requiresLabel() can be checked if the form element requires a label. A label-less form element that requires a label will prevent the form from being rendered by throwing an exception. description($languageItem = null, array $variables = []) and getDescription() can be used to set and get the description of the form element. IObjectTypeFormNode # IObjectTypeFormField has to be implemented by form nodes that rely on a object type of a specific object type definition in order to function. The implementing class has to implement the methods objectType($objectType) , getObjectType() , and getObjectTypeDefinition() . TObjectTypeFormNode provides a default implementation of these three methods. CustomFormNode # CustomFormNode is a form node whose contents can be set directly via content($content) . This class should generally not be relied on. Instead, TemplateFormNode should be used. TemplateFormNode # TemplateFormNode is a form node whose contents are read from a template. TemplateFormNode has the following additional methods: application($application) and getApplicaton() can be used to set and get the abbreviation of the application the shown template belongs to. If no template has been set explicitly, getApplicaton() returns wcf . templateName($templateName) and getTemplateName() can be used to set and get the name of the template containing the node contents. If no template has been set and the node is rendered, an exception will be thrown. variables(array $variables) and getVariables() can be used to set and get additional variables passed to the template. Form Document # A form document object represents the form as a whole and has to implement the IFormDocument interface. WoltLab Suite provides a default implementation with the FormDocument class. IFormDocument should not be implemented directly but instead FormDocument should be extended to avoid issues if the IFormDocument interface changes in the future. IFormDocument extends IFormParentNode and requires the following additional methods: action($action) and getAction() can be used set and get the action attribute of the <form> HTML element. addButton(IFormButton $button) and getButtons() can be used add and get form buttons that are shown at the bottom of the form. addDefaultButton($addDefaultButton) and hasDefaultButton() can be used to set and check if the form has the default button which is added by default unless specified otherwise. Each implementing class may define its own default button. FormDocument has a button with id submitButton , label wcf.global.button.submit , access key s , and CSS class buttonPrimary as its default button. ajax($ajax) and isAjax() can be used to set and check if the form document is requested via an AJAX request or processes data via an AJAX request. These methods are helpful for form fields that behave differently when providing data via AJAX. build() has to be called once after all nodes have been added to this document to trigger IFormNode::populate() . formMode($formMode) and getFormMode() sets the form mode. Possible form modes are: IFormDocument::FORM_MODE_CREATE has to be used when the form is used to create a new object. IFormDocument::FORM_MODE_UPDATE has to be used when the form is used to edit an existing object. getData() returns the array containing the form data and which is passed as the $parameters argument of the constructor of a database object action object. getDataHandler() returns the data handler for this document that is used to process the field data into a parameters array for the constructor of a database object action object. getEnctype() returns the encoding type of the form. If the form contains a IFileFormField , multipart/form-data is returned, otherwise null is returned. loadValues(array $data, IStorableObject $object) is used when editing an existing object to set the form field values by calling IFormField::loadValue() for all form fields. Additionally, the form mode is set to IFormDocument::FORM_MODE_UPDATE . 5.4+ markRequiredFields(bool $markRequiredFields = true): self and marksRequiredFields(): bool can be used to set and check whether fields that are required are marked (with an asterisk in the label) in the output. method($method) and getMethod() can be used to set and get the method attribute of the <form> HTML element. By default, the method is post . prefix($prefix) and getPrefix() can be used to set and get a global form prefix that is prepended to form elements\u2019 names and ids to avoid conflicts with other forms. By default, the prefix is an empty string. If a prefix of foo is set, getPrefix() returns foo_ (additional trailing underscore). requestData(array $requestData) , getRequestData($index = null) , and hasRequestData($index = null) can be used to set, get and check for specific request data. In most cases, the relevant request data is the $_POST array. In default AJAX requests handled by database object actions, however, the request data generally is in AbstractDatabaseObjectAction::$parameters . By default, $_POST is the request data. The last aspect is relevant for DialogFormDocument objects. DialogFormDocument is a specialized class for forms in dialogs that, in contrast to FormDocument do not require an action to be set. Additionally, DialogFormDocument provides the cancelable($cancelable = true) and isCancelable() methods used to determine if the dialog from can be canceled. By default, dialog forms are cancelable. Form Button # A form button object represents a button shown at the end of the form that, for example, submits the form. Every form button has to implement the IFormButton interface that extends IFormChildNode and IFormElement . IFormButton requires four methods to be implemented: accessKey($accessKey) and getAccessKey() can be used to set and get the access key with which the form button can be activated. By default, form buttons have no access key set. submit($submitButton) and isSubmit() can be used to set and check if the form button is a submit button. A submit button is an input[type=submit] element. Otherwise, the button is a button element. Form Container # A form container object represents a container for other form containers or form field directly. Every form container has to implement the IFormContainer interface which requires the following method: loadValues(array $data, IStorableObject $object) is called by IFormDocument::loadValuesFromObject() to inform the container that object data is loaded. This method is not intended to generally call IFormField::loadValues() on its form field children as these methods are already called by IFormDocument::loadValuesFromObject() . This method is intended for specialized form containers with more complex logic. There are multiple default container implementations: FormContainer is the default implementation of IFormContainer . TabMenuFormContainer represents the container of tab menu, while TabFormContainer represents a tab of a tab menu and TabTabMenuFormContainer represents a tab of a tab menu that itself contains a tab menu. The children of RowFormContainer are shown in a row and should use col-* classes. The children of RowFormFieldContainer are also shown in a row but does not show the labels and descriptions of the individual form fields. Instead of the individual labels and descriptions, the container's label and description is shown and both span all of fields. SuffixFormFieldContainer can be used for one form field with a second selection form field used as a suffix. The methods of the interfaces that FormContainer is implementing are well documented, but here is a short overview of the most important methods when setting up a form or extending a form with an event listener: appendChild(IFormChildNode $child) , appendChildren(array $children) , and insertBefore(IFormChildNode $child, $referenceNodeId) are used to insert new children into the form container. description($languageItem = null, array $variables = []) and label($languageItem = null, array $variables = []) are used to set the description and the label or title of the form container. Form Field # A form field object represents a concrete form field that allows entering data. Every form field has to implement the IFormField interface which extends IFormChildNode and IFormElement . IFormField requires the following additional methods: addValidationError(IFormFieldValidationError $error) and getValidationErrors() can be used to get and set validation errors of the form field (see form validation ). addValidator(IFormFieldValidator $validator) , getValidators() , removeValidator($validatorId) , and hasValidator($validatorId) can be used to get, set, remove, and check for validators for the form field (see form validation ). getFieldHtml() returns the field's HTML output without the surrounding dl structure. objectProperty($objectProperty) and getObjectProperty() can be used to get and set the object property that the field represents. When setting the object property is set to an empty string, the previously set object property is unset. If no object property has been set, the field\u2019s (non-prefixed) id is returned. The object property allows having different fields (requiring different ids) that represent the same object property which is handy when available options of the field\u2019s value depend on another field. Having object property allows to define different fields for each value of the other field and to use form field dependencies to only show the appropriate field. - readValue() reads the form field value from the request data after the form is submitted. - required($required = true) and isRequired() can be used to determine if the form field has to be filled out. By default, form fields do not have to be filled out. - value($value) and getSaveValue() can be used to get and set the value of the form field to be used outside of the context of forms. getValue() , in contrast, returns the internal representation of the form field\u2019s value. In general, the internal representation is only relevant when validating the value in additional validators. loadValue(array $data, IStorableObject $object) extracts the form field value from the given data array (and additional, non-editable data from the object if the field needs them). AbstractFormField provides default implementations of many of the listed methods above and should be extended instead of implementing IFormField directly. An overview of the form fields provided by default can be found here . Form Field Interfaces and Traits # WoltLab Suite Core provides a variety of interfaces and matching traits with default implementations for several common features of form fields: IAttributeFormField # Only available since version 5.4. IAttributeFormField has to be implemented by form fields for which attributes can be added to the actual form element (in addition to adding attributes to the surrounding element via the attribute-related methods of IFormNode ). The implementing class has to implement the methods fieldAttribute(string $name, string $value = null): self and getFieldAttribute(string $name): self / getFieldAttributes(): array , which are used to add and get the attributes, respectively. Additionally, hasFieldAttribute(string $name): bool has to implemented to check if a certain attribute is present, removeFieldAttribute(string $name): self to remove an attribute, and static validateFieldAttribute(string $name) to check if the attribute is valid for this specific class. TAttributeFormField provides a default implementation of these methods and TInputAttributeFormField specializes the trait for input -based form fields. These two traits also ensure that if a specific interface that handles a specific attribute is implemented, like IAutoCompleteFormField handling autocomplete , this attribute cannot be set with this API. Instead, the dedicated API provided by the relevant interface has to be used. IAutoCompleteFormField # Only available since version 5.4. IAutoCompleteFormField has to be implemented by form fields that support the autocomplete attribute . The implementing class has to implement the methods autoComplete(?string $autoComplete): self and getAutoComplete(): ?string , which are used to set and get the autocomplete value, respectively. TAutoCompleteFormField provides a default implementation of these two methods and TTextAutoCompleteFormField specializes the trait for text form fields. When using TAutoCompleteFormField , you have to implement the getValidAutoCompleteTokens(): array method which returns all valid autocomplete tokens. IAutoFocusFormField # IAutoFocusFormField has to be implemented by form fields that can be auto-focused. The implementing class has to implement the methods autoFocus($autoFocus = true) and isAutoFocused() . By default, form fields are not auto-focused. TAutoFocusFormField provides a default implementation of these two methods. ICssClassFormField # Only available since version 5.4. ICssClassFormField has to be implemented by form fields for which CSS classes can be added to the actual form element (in addition to adding CSS classes to the surrounding element via the class-related methods of IFormNode ). The implementing class has to implement the methods addFieldClass(string $class): self / addFieldClasses(array $classes): self and getFieldClasses(): array , which are used to add and get the CSS classes, respectively. Additionally, hasFieldClass(string $class): bool has to implemented to check if a certain CSS class is present and removeFieldClass(string $class): self to remove a CSS class. TCssClassFormField provides a default implementation of these methods. IFileFormField # IFileFormField has to be implemented by every form field that uploads files so that the enctype attribute of the form document is multipart/form-data (see IFormDocument::getEnctype() ). IFilterableSelectionFormField # IFilterableSelectionFormField extends ISelectionFormField by the possibilty for users when selecting the value(s) to filter the list of available options. The implementing class has to implement the methods filterable($filterable = true) and isFilterable() . TFilterableSelectionFormField provides a default implementation of these two methods. II18nFormField # II18nFormField has to be implemented by form fields if the form field value can be entered separately for all available languages. The implementing class has to implement the following methods: i18n($i18n = true) and isI18n() can be used to set whether a specific instance of the class actually supports multilingual input. i18nRequired($i18nRequired = true) and isI18nRequired() can be used to set whether a specific instance of the class requires separate values for all languages. languageItemPattern($pattern) and getLanguageItemPattern() can be used to set the pattern/regular expression for the language item used to save the multilingual values. hasI18nValues() and hasPlainValue() check if the current value is a multilingual or monolingual value. TI18nFormField provides a default implementation of these eight methods and additional default implementations of some of the IFormField methods. If multilingual input is enabled for a specific form field, classes using TI18nFormField register a custom form field data processor to add the array with multilingual input into the $parameters array directly using {$objectProperty}_i18n as the array key. If multilingual input is enabled but only a monolingual value is entered, the custom form field data processor does nothing and the form field\u2019s value is added by the DefaultFormDataProcessor into the data sub-array of the $parameters array. TI18nFormField already provides a default implementation of IFormField::validate() . IImmutableFormField # IImmutableFormField has to be implemented by form fields that support being displayed but whose value cannot be changed. The implementing class has to implement the methods immutable($immutable = true) and isImmutable() that can be used to determine if the value of the form field is mutable or immutable. By default, form field are mutable. IInputModeFormField # Only available since version 5.4. IInputModeFormField has to be implemented by form fields that support the inputmode attribute . The implementing class has to implement the methods inputMode(?string $inputMode): self and getInputMode(): ?string , which are used to set and get the input mode, respectively. TInputModeFormField provides a default implementation of these two methods. IMaximumFormField # IMaximumFormField has to be implemented by form fields if the entered value must have a maximum value. The implementing class has to implement the methods maximum($maximum = null) and getMaximum() . A maximum of null signals that no maximum value has been set. TMaximumFormField provides a default implementation of these two methods. The implementing class has to validate the entered value against the maximum value manually. IMaximumLengthFormField # IMaximumLengthFormField has to be implemented by form fields if the entered value must have a maximum length. The implementing class has to implement the methods maximumLength($maximumLength = null) , getMaximumLength() , and validateMaximumLength($text, Language $language = null) . A maximum length of null signals that no maximum length has been set. TMaximumLengthFormField provides a default implementation of these two methods. The implementing class has to validate the entered value against the maximum value manually by calling validateMaximumLength() . IMinimumFormField # IMinimumFormField has to be implemented by form fields if the entered value must have a minimum value. The implementing class has to implement the methods minimum($minimum = null) and getMinimum() . A minimum of null signals that no minimum value has been set. TMinimumFormField provides a default implementation of these three methods. The implementing class has to validate the entered value against the minimum value manually. IMinimumLengthFormField # IMinimumLengthFormField has to be implemented by form fields if the entered value must have a minimum length. The implementing class has to implement the methods minimumLength($minimumLength = null) , getMinimumLength() , and validateMinimumLength($text, Language $language = null) . A minimum length of null signals that no minimum length has been set. TMinimumLengthFormField provides a default implementation of these three methods. The implementing class has to validate the entered value against the minimum value manually by calling validateMinimumLength() . IMultipleFormField # IMinimumLengthFormField has to be implemented by form fields that support selecting or setting multiple values. The implementing class has to implement the following methods: multiple($multiple = true) and allowsMultiple() can be used to set whether a specific instance of the class actually should support multiple values. By default, multiple values are not supported. minimumMultiples($minimum) and getMinimumMultiples() can be used to set the minimum number of values that have to be selected/entered. By default, there is no required minimum number of values. maximumMultiples($minimum) and getMaximumMultiples() can be used to set the maximum number of values that have to be selected/entered. By default, there is no maximum number of values. IMultipleFormField::NO_MAXIMUM_MULTIPLES is returned if no maximum number of values has been set and it can also be used to unset a previously set maximum number of values. TMultipleFormField provides a default implementation of these six methods and classes using TMultipleFormField register a custom form field data processor to add the HtmlInputProcessor object with the text into the $parameters array directly using {$objectProperty}_htmlInputProcessor as the array key. The implementing class has to validate the values against the minimum and maximum number of values manually. INullableFormField # INullableFormField has to be implemented by form fields that support null as their (empty) value. The implementing class has to implement the methods nullable($nullable = true) and isNullable() . TNullableFormField provides a default implementation of these two methods. null should be returned by IFormField::getSaveValue() is the field is considered empty and the form field has been set as nullable. IPackagesFormField # IPackagesFormField has to be implemented by form fields that, in some way, considers packages whose ids may be passed to the field object. The implementing class has to implement the methods packageIDs(array $packageIDs) and getPackageIDs() . TPackagesFormField provides a default implementation of these two methods. IPatternFormField # Only available since version 5.4. IPatternFormField has to be implemented by form fields that support the pattern attribute . The implementing class has to implement the methods pattern(?string $pattern): self and getPattern(): ?string , which are used to set and get the pattern, respectively. TPatternFormField provides a default implementation of these two methods. IPlaceholderFormField # IPlaceholderFormField has to be implemented by form fields that support a placeholder value for empty fields. The implementing class has to implement the methods placeholder($languageItem = null, array $variables = []) and getPlaceholder() . TPlaceholderFormField provides a default implementation of these two methods. ISelectionFormField # ISelectionFormField has to be implemented by form fields with a predefined set of possible values. The implementing class has to implement the getter and setter methods options($options, $nestedOptions = false, $labelLanguageItems = true) and getOptions() and additionally two methods related to nesting, i.e. whether the selectable options have a hierarchy: supportsNestedOptions() and getNestedOptions() . TSelectionFormField provides a default implementation of these four methods. ISuffixedFormField # ISuffixedFormField has to be implemented by form fields that support supports displaying a suffix behind the actual input field. The implementing class has to implement the methods suffix($languageItem = null, array $variables = []) and getSuffix() . TSuffixedFormField provides a default implementation of these two methods. TDefaultIdFormField # Form fields that have a default id have to use TDefaultIdFormField and have to implement the method getDefaultId() . Displaying Forms # The only thing to do in a template to display the whole form including all of the necessary JavaScript is to put 1 { @ $form -> getHtml () } into the template file at the relevant position.","title":"Structure"},{"location":"php/api/form_builder/structure/#structure-of-form-builder","text":"Forms built with form builder consist of three major structural elements listed from top to bottom: form document, form container, form field.

If the form node consists of multiple (nested) HTML elements, the classes are generally added to the top element. static validateClass($class) is used to check if a given CSS class is valid. By default, a form node has no CSS classes. addDependency(IFormFieldDependency $dependency) , removeDependency($dependencyId) , getDependencies() , and hasDependency($dependencyId) add, remove, get, and check for dependencies of this form node on other form fields. checkDependencies() checks if all of the node\u2019s dependencies are met and returns a boolean value reflecting the check\u2019s result. The form builder dependency documentation provides more detailed information about dependencies and how they work. By default, a form node has no dependencies. attribute($name, $value = null) , removeAttribute($name) , getAttribute($name) , getAttributes() , hasAttribute($name) add, remove, get, and check for attributes of the HTML element represting the form node. The attributes are added to the same element that the CSS classes are added to. static validateAttribute($name) is used to check if a given attribute is valid. By default, a form node has no attributes. available($available = true) and isAvailable() can be used to set and check if the node is available. The availability functionality can be used to easily toggle form nodes based, for example, on options without having to create a condition to append the relevant. This way of checking availability makes it easier to set up forms. By default, every form node is available. The following aspects are important when working with availability: Unavailable fields produce no output, their value is not read, they are not validated and they are not checked for save values. Form fields are also able to mark themselves as unavailable, for example, a selection field without any options. Form containers are automatically unavailable if they contain no available children. Availability sets the static availability for form nodes that does not change during the lifetime of a form. In contrast, dependencies represent a dynamic availability for form nodes that depends on the current value of certain form fields. - cleanup() is called after the whole form is not used anymore to reset other APIs if the form fields depends on them and they expect such a reset. This method is not intended to clean up the form field\u2019s value as a new form document object is created to show a clean form. - getDocument() returns the IFormDocument object the node belongs to. (As IFormDocument extends IFormNode , form document objects simply return themselves.) - getHtml() returns the HTML representation of the node. getHtmlVariables() return template variables (in addition to the form node itself) to render the node\u2019s HTML representation. - id($id) and getId() set and get the id of the form node. Every id has to be unique within a form. getPrefixedId() returns the prefixed version of the node\u2019s id (see IFormDocument::getPrefix() and IFormDocument::prefix() ). static validateId($id) is used to check if a given id is valid. - populate() is called by IFormDocument::build() after all form nodes have been added. This method should finilize the initialization of the form node after all parent-child relations of the form document have been established. This method is needed because during the construction of a form node, it neither knows the form document it will belong to nor does it know its parent. - validate() checks, after the form is submitted, if the form node is valid. A form node with children is valid if all of its child nodes are valid. A form field is valid if its value is valid. - static create($id) is the factory method that has to be used to create new form nodes with the given id.

The first file for our package is the install_com.woltlab.wcf.people.php file used to create such a database table during package installation: files/acp/database/install_com.woltlab.wcf.people.php 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 <? php use wcf\\system\\database\\table\\column\\NotNullVarchar255DatabaseTableColumn ; use wcf\\system\\database\\table\\column\\ObjectIdDatabaseTableColumn ; use wcf\\system\\database\\table\\DatabaseTable ; use wcf\\system\\database\\table\\index\\DatabaseTablePrimaryIndex ; return [ DatabaseTable :: create ( 'wcf1_person' ) -> columns ([ ObjectIdDatabaseTableColumn :: create ( 'personID' ), NotNullVarchar255DatabaseTableColumn :: create ( 'firstName' ), NotNullVarchar255DatabaseTableColumn :: create ( 'lastName' ), ]) -> indices ([ DatabaseTablePrimaryIndex :: create () -> columns ([ 'personID' ]), ]), ]; Database Object # Person # In our PHP code, each person will be represented by an object of the following class: files/lib/data/person/Person.class.php 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 <? php namespace wcf\\data\\person ; use wcf\\data\\DatabaseObject ; use wcf\\system\\request\\IRouteController ; /** * Represents a person. * * @author Matthias Schmidt * @copyright 2001-2021 WoltLab GmbH * @license GNU Lesser General Public License <http://opensource.org/licenses/lgpl-license.php> * @package WoltLabSuite\\Core\\Data\\Person * * @property-read int $personID unique id of the person * @property-read string $firstName first name of the person * @property-read string $lastName last name of the person */ class Person extends DatabaseObject implements IRouteController { /** * Returns the first and last name of the person if a person object is treated as a string. * * @return string */ public function __toString () { return $this -> getTitle (); } /** * @inheritDoc */ public function getTitle () { return $this -> firstName . ' ' . $this -> lastName ; } } The important thing here is that Person extends DatabaseObject . Additionally, we implement the IRouteController interface, which allows us to use Person objects to create links, and we implement PHP's magic __toString() method for convenience. For every database object, you need to implement three additional classes: an action class, an editor class and a list class. PersonAction # files/lib/data/person/PersonAction.class.php 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 <? php namespace wcf\\data\\person ; use wcf\\data\\AbstractDatabaseObjectAction ; /** * Executes person-related actions. * * @author Matthias Schmidt * @copyright 2001-2021 WoltLab GmbH * @license GNU Lesser General Public License <http://opensource.org/licenses/lgpl-license.php> * @package WoltLabSuite\\Core\\Data\\Person * * @method Person create() * @method PersonEditor[] getObjects() * @method PersonEditor getSingleObject() */ class PersonAction extends AbstractDatabaseObjectAction { /** * @inheritDoc */ protected $permissionsDelete = [ 'admin.content.canManagePeople' ]; /** * @inheritDoc */ protected $requireACP = [ 'delete' ]; } This implementation of AbstractDatabaseObjectAction is very basic and only sets the $permissionsDelete and $requireACP properties. This is done so that later on, when implementing the people list for the ACP, we can delete people simply via AJAX. $permissionsDelete has to be set to the permission needed in order to delete a person. We will later use the userGroupOption package installation plugin to create the admin.content.canManagePeople permission. $requireACP restricts deletion of people to the ACP. PersonEditor # files/lib/data/person/PersonEditor.class.php 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 <? php namespace wcf\\data\\person ; use wcf\\data\\DatabaseObjectEditor ; /** * Provides functions to edit people. * * @author Matthias Schmidt * @copyright 2001-2021 WoltLab GmbH * @license GNU Lesser General Public License <http://opensource.org/licenses/lgpl-license.php> * @package WoltLabSuite\\Core\\Data\\Person * * @method static Person create(array $parameters = []) * @method Person getDecoratedObject() * @mixin Person */ class PersonEditor extends DatabaseObjectEditor { /** * @inheritDoc */ protected static $baseClass = Person :: class ; } This implementation of DatabaseObjectEditor fulfills the minimum requirement for a database object editor: setting the static $baseClass property to the database object class name.

ACP # Next, we will take care of the controllers and views for the ACP. In total, we need three each: page to list people, form to add people, and form to edit people. Before we create the controllers and views, let us first create the menu items for the pages in the ACP menu. ACP Menu # We need to create three menu items: a \u201cparent\u201d menu item on the second level of the ACP menu item tree, a third level menu item for the people list page, and a fourth level menu item for the form to add new people. acpMenu.xml 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <data xmlns= \"http://www.woltlab.com\" xmlns:xsi= \"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation= \"http://www.woltlab.com http://www.woltlab.com/XSD/5.4/acpMenu.xsd\" > <import> <acpmenuitem name= \"wcf.acp.menu.link.person\" > <parent> wcf.acp.menu.link.content </parent> </acpmenuitem> <acpmenuitem name= \"wcf.acp.menu.link.person.list\" > <controller> wcf\\acp\\page\\PersonListPage </controller> <parent> wcf.acp.menu.link.person </parent> <permissions> admin.content.canManagePeople </permissions> </acpmenuitem> <acpmenuitem name= \"wcf.acp.menu.link.person.add\" > <controller> wcf\\acp\\form\\PersonAddForm </controller> <parent> wcf.acp.menu.link.person.list </parent> <permissions> admin.content.canManagePeople </permissions> <icon> fa-plus </icon> </acpmenuitem> </import> </data> We choose wcf.acp.menu.link.content as the parent menu item for the first menu item wcf.acp.menu.link.person because the people we are managing is just one form of content. The fourth level menu item wcf.acp.menu.link.person.add will only be shown as an icon and thus needs an additional element icon which takes a FontAwesome icon class as value. People List # To list the people in the ACP, we need a PersonListPage class and a personList template. PersonListPage # files/lib/acp/page/PersonListPage.class.php 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 <? php namespace wcf\\acp\\page ; use wcf\\data\\person\\PersonList ; use wcf\\page\\SortablePage ; /** * Shows the list of people. * * @author Matthias Schmidt * @copyright 2001-2021 WoltLab GmbH * @license GNU Lesser General Public License <http://opensource.org/licenses/lgpl-license.php> * @package WoltLabSuite\\Core\\Acp\\Page */ class PersonListPage extends SortablePage { /** * @inheritDoc */ public $activeMenuItem = 'wcf.acp.menu.link.person.list' ; /** * @inheritDoc */ public $neededPermissions = [ 'admin.content.canManagePeople' ]; /** * @inheritDoc */ public $objectListClassName = PersonList :: class ; /** * @inheritDoc */ public $validSortFields = [ 'personID' , 'firstName' , 'lastName' ]; } As WoltLab Suite Core already provides a powerful default implementation of a sortable page, our work here is minimal: We need to set the active ACP menu item via the $activeMenuItem . $neededPermissions contains a list of permissions of which the user needs to have at least one in order to see the person list. We use the same permission for both the menu item and the page. The database object list class whose name is provided via $objectListClassName and that handles fetching the people from database is the PersonList class, which we have already created. To validate the sort field passed with the request, we set $validSortFields to the available database table columns. personList.tpl # acptemplates/personList.tpl 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 { include file = 'header' pageTitle = 'wcf.acp.person.list' } <header class=\"contentHeader\"> <div class=\"contentHeaderTitle\"> <h1 class=\"contentTitle\"> { lang } wcf.acp.person.list { /lang } </h1> </div> <nav class=\"contentHeaderNavigation\"> <ul> <li><a href=\" { link controller = 'PersonAdd' }{ /link } \" class=\"button\"><span class=\"icon icon16 fa-plus\"></span> <span> { lang } wcf.acp.menu.link.person.add { /lang } </span></a></li> { event name = 'contentHeaderNavigation' } </ul> </nav> </header> { hascontent } <div class=\"paginationTop\"> { content }{ pages print = true assign = pagesLinks controller = \"PersonList\" link = \"pageNo=%d&sortField=$sortField&sortOrder=$sortOrder\" }{ /content } </div> { /hascontent } { if $objects | count } <div class=\"section tabularBox\"> <table class=\"table jsObjectActionContainer\" data-object-action-class-name=\"wcf\\data\\person\\PersonAction\"> <thead> <tr> <th class=\"columnID columnPersonID { if $sortField == 'personID' } active { @ $sortOrder }{ /if } \" colspan=\"2\"><a href=\" { link controller = 'PersonList' } pageNo= { @ $pageNo } &sortField=personID&sortOrder= { if $sortField == 'personID' && $sortOrder == 'ASC' } DESC { else } ASC { /if }{ /link } \"> { lang } wcf.global.objectID { /lang } </a></th> <th class=\"columnTitle columnFirstName { if $sortField == 'firstName' } active { @ $sortOrder }{ /if } \"><a href=\" { link controller = 'PersonList' } pageNo= { @ $pageNo } &sortField=firstName&sortOrder= { if $sortField == 'firstName' && $sortOrder == 'ASC' } DESC { else } ASC { /if }{ /link } \"> { lang } wcf.person.firstName { /lang } </a></th> <th class=\"columnTitle columnLastName { if $sortField == 'lastName' } active { @ $sortOrder }{ /if } \"><a href=\" { link controller = 'PersonList' } pageNo= { @ $pageNo } &sortField=lastName&sortOrder= { if $sortField == 'lastName' && $sortOrder == 'ASC' } DESC { else } ASC { /if }{ /link } \"> { lang } wcf.person.lastName { /lang } </a></th> { event name = 'columnHeads' } </tr> </thead> <tbody class=\"jsReloadPageWhenEmpty\"> { foreach from = $objects item = person } <tr class=\"jsObjectActionObject\" data-object-id=\" { @ $person -> getObjectID () } \"> <td class=\"columnIcon\"> <a href=\" { link controller = 'PersonEdit' object = $person }{ /link } \" title=\" { lang } wcf.global.button.edit { /lang } \" class=\"jsTooltip\"><span class=\"icon icon16 fa-pencil\"></span></a> { objectAction action = \"delete\" objectTitle = $person -> getTitle () } { event name = 'rowButtons' } </td> <td class=\"columnID\"> { # $person -> personID } </td> <td class=\"columnTitle columnFirstName\"><a href=\" { link controller = 'PersonEdit' object = $person }{ /link } \"> { $person -> firstName } </a></td> <td class=\"columnTitle columnLastName\"><a href=\" { link controller = 'PersonEdit' object = $person }{ /link } \"> { $person -> lastName } </a></td> { event name = 'columns' } </tr> { /foreach } </tbody> </table> </div> <footer class=\"contentFooter\"> { hascontent } <div class=\"paginationBottom\"> { content }{ @ $pagesLinks }{ /content } </div> { /hascontent } <nav class=\"contentFooterNavigation\"> <ul> <li><a href=\" { link controller = 'PersonAdd' }{ /link } \" class=\"button\"><span class=\"icon icon16 fa-plus\"></span> <span> { lang } wcf.acp.menu.link.person.add { /lang } </span></a></li> { event name = 'contentFooterNavigation' } </ul> </nav> </footer> { else } <p class=\"info\"> { lang } wcf.global.noItems { /lang } </p> { /if } { include file = 'footer' } We will go piece by piece through the template code: We include the header template and set the page title wcf.acp.person.list . You have to include this template for every page! We set the content header and additional provide a button to create a new person in the content header navigation. As not all people are listed on the same page if many people have been created, we need a pagination for which we use the pages template plugin. The {hascontent}{content}{/content}{/hascontent} construct ensures the .paginationTop element is only shown if the pages template plugin has a return value, thus if a pagination is necessary. Now comes the main part of the page, the list of the people, which will only be displayed if any people exist. Otherwise, an info box is displayed using the generic wcf.global.noItems language item. The $objects template variable is automatically assigned by wcf\\page\\MultipleLinkPage and contains the PersonList object used to read the people from database. The table itself consists of a thead and a tbody element and is extendable with more columns using the template events columnHeads and columns . In general, every table should provide these events. The default structure of a table is used here so that the first column of the content rows contains icons to edit and to delete the row (and provides another standard event rowButtons ) and that the second column contains the ID of the person. The table can be sorted by clicking on the head of each column. The used variables $sortField and $sortOrder are automatically assigned to the template by SortablePage . The .contentFooter element is only shown if people exist as it basically repeats the .contentHeaderNavigation and .paginationTop element. The delete button for each person shown in the .columnIcon element relies on the global WoltLabSuite/Core/Ui/Object/Action module which only requires the jsObjectActionContainer CSS class in combination with the data-object-action-class-name attribute for the table element, the jsObjectActionObject CSS class for each person's tr element in combination with the data-object-id attribute, and lastly the delete button itself, which is created with the objectAction template plugin . The .jsReloadPageWhenEmpty CSS class on the tbody element ensures that once all persons on the page have been deleted, the page is reloaded. Lastly, the footer template is included that terminates the page. You also have to include this template for every page! Now, we have finished the page to manage the people so that we can move on to the forms with which we actually create and edit the people. Person Add Form # Like the person list, the form to add new people requires a controller class and a template. PersonAddForm # files/lib/acp/form/PersonAddForm.class.php 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 <? php namespace wcf\\acp\\form ; use wcf\\data\\person\\PersonAction ; use wcf\\form\\AbstractFormBuilderForm ; use wcf\\system\\form\\builder\\container\\FormContainer ; use wcf\\system\\form\\builder\\field\\TextFormField ; /** * Shows the form to create a new person. * * @author Matthias Schmidt * @copyright 2001-2021 WoltLab GmbH * @license GNU Lesser General Public License <http://opensource.org/licenses/lgpl-license.php> * @package WoltLabSuite\\Core\\Acp\\Form */ class PersonAddForm extends AbstractFormBuilderForm { /** * @inheritDoc */ public $activeMenuItem = 'wcf.acp.menu.link.person.add' ; /** * @inheritDoc */ public $formAction = 'create' ; /** * @inheritDoc */ public $neededPermissions = [ 'admin.content.canManagePeople' ]; /** * @inheritDoc */ public $objectActionClass = PersonAction :: class ; /** * @inheritDoc */ public $objectEditLinkController = PersonEditForm :: class ; /** * @inheritDoc */ protected function createForm () { parent :: createForm (); $this -> form -> appendChild ( FormContainer :: create ( 'data' ) -> label ( 'wcf.global.form.data' ) -> appendChildren ([ TextFormField :: create ( 'firstName' ) -> label ( 'wcf.person.firstName' ) -> required () -> autoFocus () -> maximumLength ( 255 ), TextFormField :: create ( 'lastName' ) -> label ( 'wcf.person.lastName' ) -> required () -> maximumLength ( 255 ), ]) ); } } The properties here consist of three types: the \u201chousekeeping\u201d properties $activeMenuItem and $neededPermissions , which fulfill the same roles as for PersonListPage , and the $objectEditLinkController property , which is used to generate a link to edit the newly created person after submitting the form, and finally $formAction and $objectActionClass required by the PHP form builder API used to generate the form. Because of using form builder, we only have to set up the two form fields for entering the first and last name, respectively: Each field is a simple single-line text field, thus we use TextFormField . The parameter of the create() method expects the id of the field/name of the database object property, which is firstName and lastName , respectively, here. The language item of the label shown in the ouput above the input field is set via the label() method. As both fields have to be filled out, required() is called, and the maximum length is set via maximumLength() . Lastly, to make it easier to fill out the form more quickly, the first field is auto-focused by calling autoFocus() . personAdd.tpl # acptemplates/personAdd.tpl 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 { include file = 'header' pageTitle = 'wcf.acp.person.' | concat : $action } <header class=\"contentHeader\"> <div class=\"contentHeaderTitle\"> <h1 class=\"contentTitle\"> { lang } wcf.acp.person. { $action }{ /lang } </h1> </div> <nav class=\"contentHeaderNavigation\"> <ul> <li><a href=\" { link controller = 'PersonList' }{ /link } \" class=\"button\"><span class=\"icon icon16 fa-list\"></span> <span> { lang } wcf.acp.menu.link.person.list { /lang } </span></a></li> { event name = 'contentHeaderNavigation' } </ul> </nav> </header> { @ $form -> getHtml () } { include file = 'footer' } We will now only concentrate on the new parts compared to personList.tpl : We use the $action variable to distinguish between the languages items used for adding a person and for creating a person. Because of form builder, we only have to call {@$form->getHtml()} to generate all relevant output for the form. Person Edit Form # As mentioned before, for the form to edit existing people, we only need a new controller as the template has already been implemented in a way that it handles both, adding and editing. PersonEditForm # files/lib/acp/form/PersonEditForm.class.php 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 <? php namespace wcf\\acp\\form ; use wcf\\data\\person\\Person ; use wcf\\system\\exception\\IllegalLinkException ; /** * Shows the form to edit an existing person. * * @author Matthias Schmidt * @copyright 2001-2021 WoltLab GmbH * @license GNU Lesser General Public License <http://opensource.org/licenses/lgpl-license.php> * @package WoltLabSuite\\Core\\Acp\\Form */ class PersonEditForm extends PersonAddForm { /** * @inheritDoc */ public $activeMenuItem = 'wcf.acp.menu.link.person' ; /** * @inheritDoc */ public $formAction = 'update' ; /** * @inheritDoc */ public function readParameters () { parent :: readParameters (); if ( isset ( $_REQUEST [ 'id' ])) { $this -> formObject = new Person ( $_REQUEST [ 'id' ]); if ( ! $this -> formObject -> getObjectID ()) { throw new IllegalLinkException (); } } } } In general, edit forms extend the associated add form so that the code to read and to validate the input data is simply inherited. After setting a different active menu item, we have to change the value of $formAction because this form, in contrast to PersonAddForm , does not create but update existing persons. As we rely on form builder, the only thing necessary in this controller is to read and validate the edit object, i.e. the edited person, which is done in readParameters() . Frontend # For the front end, that means the part with which the visitors of a website interact, we want to implement a simple sortable page that lists the people. This page should also be directly linked in the main menu. page.xml # First, let us register the page with the system because every front end page or form needs to be explicitly registered using the page package installation plugin : page.xml 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <data xmlns= \"http://www.woltlab.com\" xmlns:xsi= \"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation= \"http://www.woltlab.com http://www.woltlab.com/XSD/5.4/page.xsd\" > <import> <page identifier= \"com.woltlab.wcf.people.PersonList\" > <pageType> system </pageType> <controller> wcf\\page\\PersonListPage </controller> <name language= \"de\" > Personen-Liste </name> <name language= \"en\" > Person List </name> <content language= \"de\" > <title> Personen </title> </content> <content language= \"en\" > <title> People </title> </content> </page> </import> </data> For more information about what each of the elements means, please refer to the page package installation plugin page . menuItem.xml # Next, we register the menu item using the menuItem package installation plugin : menuItem.xml 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <data xmlns= \"http://www.woltlab.com\" xmlns:xsi= \"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation= \"http://www.woltlab.com http://www.woltlab.com/XSD/5.4/menuItem.xsd\" > <import> <item identifier= \"com.woltlab.wcf.people.PersonList\" > <menu> com.woltlab.wcf.MainMenu </menu> <title language= \"de\" > Personen </title> <title language= \"en\" > People </title> <page> com.woltlab.wcf.people.PersonList </page> </item> </import> </data> Here, the import parts are that we register the menu item for the main menu com.woltlab.wcf.MainMenu and link the menu item with the page com.woltlab.wcf.people.PersonList , which we just registered. People List # As in the ACP, we need a controller and a template. You might notice that both the controller\u2019s (unqualified) class name and the template name are the same for the ACP and the front end.

In the front end, we do not need to set the active menu item manually because the system determines the active menu item automatically based on the requested page. Furthermore, $neededPermissions has not been set because in the front end, users do not need any special permission to access the page. In the front end, we explicitly set the $defaultSortField so that the people listed on the page are sorted by their last name (in ascending order) by default. personList.tpl # templates/personList.tpl 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 { capture assign = 'contentTitle' }{ lang } wcf.person.list { /lang } <span class=\"badge\"> { # $items } </span> { /capture } { capture assign = 'headContent' } { if $pageNo < $pages } <link rel=\"next\" href=\" { link controller = 'PersonList' } pageNo= { @ $pageNo + 1 }{ /link } \"> { /if } { if $pageNo > 1 } <link rel=\"prev\" href=\" { link controller = 'PersonList' }{ if $pageNo > 2 } pageNo= { @ $pageNo - 1 }{ /if }{ /link } \"> { /if } <link rel=\"canonical\" href=\" { link controller = 'PersonList' }{ if $pageNo > 1 } pageNo= { @ $pageNo }{ /if }{ /link } \"> { /capture } { capture assign = 'sidebarRight' } <section class=\"box\"> <form method=\"post\" action=\" { link controller = 'PersonList' }{ /link } \"> <h2 class=\"boxTitle\"> { lang } wcf.global.sorting { /lang } </h2> <div class=\"boxContent\"> <dl> <dt></dt> <dd> <select id=\"sortField\" name=\"sortField\"> <option value=\"firstName\" { if $sortField == 'firstName' } selected { /if } > { lang } wcf.person.firstName { /lang } </option> <option value=\"lastName\" { if $sortField == 'lastName' } selected { /if } > { lang } wcf.person.lastName { /lang } </option> { event name = 'sortField' } </select> <select name=\"sortOrder\"> <option value=\"ASC\" { if $sortOrder == 'ASC' } selected { /if } > { lang } wcf.global.sortOrder.ascending { /lang } </option> <option value=\"DESC\" { if $sortOrder == 'DESC' } selected { /if } > { lang } wcf.global.sortOrder.descending { /lang } </option> </select> </dd> </dl> <div class=\"formSubmit\"> <input type=\"submit\" value=\" { lang } wcf.global.button.submit { /lang } \" accesskey=\"s\"> </div> </div> </form> </section> { /capture } { include file = 'header' } { hascontent } <div class=\"paginationTop\"> { content } { pages print = true assign = pagesLinks controller = 'PersonList' link = \"pageNo=%d&sortField=$sortField&sortOrder=$sortOrder\" } { /content } </div> { /hascontent } { if $items } <div class=\"section sectionContainerList\"> <ol class=\"containerList personList\"> { foreach from = $objects item = person } <li> <div class=\"box48\"> <span class=\"icon icon48 fa-user\"></span> <div class=\"details personInformation\"> <div class=\"containerHeadline\"> <h3> { $person } </h3> </div> { hascontent } <ul class=\"inlineList commaSeparated\"> { content }{ event name = 'personData' }{ /content } </ul> { /hascontent } { hascontent } <dl class=\"plain inlineDataList small\"> { content }{ event name = 'personStatistics' }{ /content } </dl> { /hascontent } </div> </div> </li> { /foreach } </ol> </div> { else } <p class=\"info\"> { lang } wcf.global.noItems { /lang } </p> { /if } <footer class=\"contentFooter\"> { hascontent } <div class=\"paginationBottom\"> { content }{ @ $pagesLinks }{ /content } </div> { /hascontent } { hascontent } <nav class=\"contentFooterNavigation\"> <ul> { content }{ event name = 'contentFooterNavigation' }{ /content } </ul> </nav> { /hascontent } </footer> { include file = 'footer' } If you compare this template to the one used in the ACP, you will recognize similar elements like the .paginationTop element, the p.info element if no people exist, and the .contentFooter element. Furthermore, we include a template called header before actually showing any of the page contents and terminate the template by including the footer template. Now, let us take a closer look at the differences: We do not explicitly create a .contentHeader element but simply assign the title to the contentTitle variable. The value of the assignment is simply the title of the page and a badge showing the number of listed people. The header template that we include later will handle correctly displaying the content header on its own based on the $contentTitle variable. Next, we create additional element for the HTML document\u2019s <head> element. In this case, we define the canonical link of the page and, because we are showing paginated content, add links to the previous and next page (if they exist). We want the page to be sortable but as we will not be using a table for listing the people like in the ACP, we are not able to place links to sort the people into the table head. Instead, usually a box is created in the sidebar on the right-hand side that contains select elements to determine sort field and sort order. The main part of the page is the listing of the people. We use a structure similar to the one used for displaying registered users. Here, for each person, we simply display a FontAwesome icon representing a person and show the person\u2019s full name relying on Person::__toString() . Additionally, like in the user list, we provide the initially empty ul.inlineList.commaSeparated and dl.plain.inlineDataList.small elements that can be filled by plugins using the templates events. userGroupOption.xml # We have already used the admin.content.canManagePeople permissions several times, now we need to install it using the userGroupOption package installation plugin : userGroupOption.xml 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <data xmlns= \"http://www.woltlab.com\" xmlns:xsi= \"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation= \"http://www.woltlab.com http://www.woltlab.com/XSD/5.4/userGroupOption.xsd\" > <import> <options> <option name= \"admin.content.canManagePeople\" > <categoryname> admin.content </categoryname> <optiontype> boolean </optiontype> <defaultvalue> 0 </defaultvalue> <admindefaultvalue> 1 </admindefaultvalue> <usersonly> 1 </usersonly> </option> </options> </import> </data> We use the existing admin.content user group option category for the permission as the people are \u201ccontent\u201d (similar the the ACP menu item). As the permission is for administrators only, we set defaultvalue to 0 and admindefaultvalue to 1 . This permission is only relevant for registered users so that it should not be visible when editing the guest user group. This is achieved by setting usersonly to 1 . package.xml # Lastly, we need to create the package.xml file.

We require the latest version (when writing this tutorial) 5.4.0 Alpha 1 . Additionally, we disallow installation of the package in the next major version 6.0 by excluding the 6.0.0 Alpha 1 version. The most important part are to installation instructions. First, we install the ACP templates, files and templates, create the database table and import the language item. Afterwards, the ACP menu items and the permission are added. Now comes the part of the instructions where the order of the instructions is crucial: In menuItem.xml , we refer to the com.woltlab.wcf.people.PersonList page that is delivered by page.xml . As the menu item package installation plugin validates the given page and throws an exception if the page does not exist, we need to install the page before the menu item! This concludes the first part of our tutorial series after which you now have a working simple package with which you can manage people in the ACP and show the visitors of your website a simple list of all created people in the front end.

You have to include this template for every page! We set the content header and additional provide a button to create a new person in the content header navigation. As not all people are listed on the same page if many people have been created, we need a pagination for which we use the pages template plugin. The {hascontent}{content}{/content}{/hascontent} construct ensures the .paginationTop element is only shown if the pages template plugin has a return value, thus if a pagination is necessary. Now comes the main part of the page, the list of the people, which will only be displayed if any people exist. Otherwise, an info box is displayed using the generic wcf.global.noItems language item. The $objects template variable is automatically assigned by wcf\\page\\MultipleLinkPage and contains the PersonList object used to read the people from database. The table itself consists of a thead and a tbody element and is extendable with more columns using the template events columnHeads and columns . In general, every table should provide these events. The default structure of a table is used here so that the first column of the content rows contains icons to edit and to delete the row (and provides another standard event rowButtons ) and that the second column contains the ID of the person. The table can be sorted by clicking on the head of each column. The used variables $sortField and $sortOrder are automatically assigned to the template by SortablePage . The .contentFooter element is only shown if people exist as it basically repeats the .contentHeaderNavigation and .paginationTop element. The delete button for each person shown in the .columnIcon element relies on the global WoltLabSuite/Core/Ui/Object/Action module which only requires the jsObjectActionContainer CSS class in combination with the data-object-action-class-name attribute for the table element, the jsObjectActionObject CSS class for each person's tr element in combination with the data-object-id attribute, and lastly the delete button itself, which is created with the objectAction template plugin . The .jsReloadPageWhenEmpty CSS class on the tbody element ensures that once all persons on the page have been deleted, the page is reloaded. Lastly, the footer template is included that terminates the page. You also have to include this template for every page! Now, we have finished the page to manage the people so that we can move on to the forms with which we actually create and edit the people.","title":"personList.tpl"},{"location":"tutorial/series/part_1/#person-add-form","text":"Like the person list, the form to add new people requires a controller class and a template.","title":"Person Add Form"},{"location":"tutorial/series/part_1/#personaddform","text":"files/lib/acp/form/PersonAddForm.class.php 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 <? php namespace wcf\\acp\\form ; use wcf\\data\\person\\PersonAction ; use wcf\\form\\AbstractFormBuilderForm ; use wcf\\system\\form\\builder\\container\\FormContainer ; use wcf\\system\\form\\builder\\field\\TextFormField ; /** * Shows the form to create a new person. * * @author Matthias Schmidt * @copyright 2001-2021 WoltLab GmbH * @license GNU Lesser General Public License <http://opensource.org/licenses/lgpl-license.php> * @package WoltLabSuite\\Core\\Acp\\Form */ class PersonAddForm extends AbstractFormBuilderForm { /** * @inheritDoc */ public $activeMenuItem = 'wcf.acp.menu.link.person.add' ; /** * @inheritDoc */ public $formAction = 'create' ; /** * @inheritDoc */ public $neededPermissions = [ 'admin.content.canManagePeople' ]; /** * @inheritDoc */ public $objectActionClass = PersonAction :: class ; /** * @inheritDoc */ public $objectEditLinkController = PersonEditForm :: class ; /** * @inheritDoc */ protected function createForm () { parent :: createForm (); $this -> form -> appendChild ( FormContainer :: create ( 'data' ) -> label ( 'wcf.global.form.data' ) -> appendChildren ([ TextFormField :: create ( 'firstName' ) -> label ( 'wcf.person.firstName' ) -> required () -> autoFocus () -> maximumLength ( 255 ), TextFormField :: create ( 'lastName' ) -> label ( 'wcf.person.lastName' ) -> required () -> maximumLength ( 255 ), ]) ); } } The properties here consist of three types: the \u201chousekeeping\u201d properties $activeMenuItem and $neededPermissions , which fulfill the same roles as for PersonListPage , and the $objectEditLinkController property , which is used to generate a link to edit the newly created person after submitting the form, and finally $formAction and $objectActionClass required by the PHP form builder API used to generate the form. Because of using form builder, we only have to set up the two form fields for entering the first and last name, respectively: Each field is a simple single-line text field, thus we use TextFormField . The parameter of the create() method expects the id of the field/name of the database object property, which is firstName and lastName , respectively, here. The language item of the label shown in the ouput above the input field is set via the label() method. As both fields have to be filled out, required() is called, and the maximum length is set via maximumLength() . Lastly, to make it easier to fill out the form more quickly, the first field is auto-focused by calling autoFocus() .","title":"PersonAddForm"},{"location":"tutorial/series/part_1/#personaddtpl","text":"acptemplates/personAdd.tpl 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 { include file = 'header' pageTitle = 'wcf.acp.person.' | concat : $action } <header class=\"contentHeader\"> <div class=\"contentHeaderTitle\"> <h1 class=\"contentTitle\"> { lang } wcf.acp.person. { $action }{ /lang } </h1> </div> <nav class=\"contentHeaderNavigation\"> <ul> <li><a href=\" { link controller = 'PersonList' }{ /link } \" class=\"button\"><span class=\"icon icon16 fa-list\"></span> <span> { lang } wcf.acp.menu.link.person.list { /lang } </span></a></li> { event name = 'contentHeaderNavigation' } </ul> </nav> </header> { @ $form -> getHtml () } { include file = 'footer' } We will now only concentrate on the new parts compared to personList.tpl : We use the $action variable to distinguish between the languages items used for adding a person and for creating a person.

Furthermore, we include a template called header before actually showing any of the page contents and terminate the template by including the footer template. Now, let us take a closer look at the differences: We do not explicitly create a .contentHeader element but simply assign the title to the contentTitle variable. The value of the assignment is simply the title of the page and a badge showing the number of listed people. The header template that we include later will handle correctly displaying the content header on its own based on the $contentTitle variable. Next, we create additional element for the HTML document\u2019s <head> element. In this case, we define the canonical link of the page and, because we are showing paginated content, add links to the previous and next page (if they exist). We want the page to be sortable but as we will not be using a table for listing the people like in the ACP, we are not able to place links to sort the people into the table head. Instead, usually a box is created in the sidebar on the right-hand side that contains select elements to determine sort field and sort order. The main part of the page is the listing of the people. We use a structure similar to the one used for displaying registered users. Here, for each person, we simply display a FontAwesome icon representing a person and show the person\u2019s full name relying on Person::__toString() . Additionally, like in the user list, we provide the initially empty ul.inlineList.commaSeparated and dl.plain.inlineDataList.small elements that can be filled by plugins using the templates events.","title":"personList.tpl"},{"location":"tutorial/series/part_1/#usergroupoptionxml","text":"We have already used the admin.content.canManagePeople permissions several times, now we need to install it using the userGroupOption package installation plugin : userGroupOption.xml 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <data xmlns= \"http://www.woltlab.com\" xmlns:xsi= \"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation= \"http://www.woltlab.com http://www.woltlab.com/XSD/5.4/userGroupOption.xsd\" > <import> <options> <option name= \"admin.content.canManagePeople\" > <categoryname> admin.content </categoryname> <optiontype> boolean </optiontype> <defaultvalue> 0 </defaultvalue> <admindefaultvalue> 1 </admindefaultvalue> <usersonly> 1 </usersonly> </option> </options> </import> </data> We use the existing admin.content user group option category for the permission as the people are \u201ccontent\u201d (similar the the ACP menu item).

For templates that are included via template listeners, this is the naming convention we use. Putting the template code into a file has the advantage that in the administrator is able to edit the code directly via a custom template group, even though in this case this might not be very probable. To show the birthday, we use the following template code for the personStatistics template event, which again makes sure that the birthday is only shown if it is actually set: templates/__personListBirthday.tpl 1 2 3 4 { if $person -> birthday } <dt> { lang } wcf.person.birthday { /lang } </dt> <dd> { @ $person -> birthday | strtotime | date } </dd> { /if } templateListener.xml #

More information about comment permissions can be found here . The getLink() method returns the link to the person with the passed comment id. As in isAccessible() , PersonRuntimeCache is used to potentially save database queries. The isAccessible() method checks if the active user can access the relevant person. As we do not have any special restrictions for accessing people, we only need to check if the person exists. The getTitle() method returns the title used for comments and responses, which is just a generic language item in this case. The updateCounter() updates the comments\u2019 counter of the person. We have added a new comments database table column to the wcf1_person database table in order to keep track on the number of comments. Additionally, we have added a new enableComments database table column to the wcf1_person database table whose value can be set when creating or editing a person in the ACP. With this option, comments on individual people can be disabled. Liking comments is already built-in and only requires some extra code in the PersonPage class for showing the likes of pre-loaded comments.

The rest of the code only handles fetching the list of comments on the requested person. In readData() , this list is fetched using CommentHandler::getCommentList() if comments are enabled for the person. The assignVariables() method assigns some additional template variables like $commentCanAdd , which is 1 if the active person can add comments and is 0 otherwise, $lastCommentTime , which contains the UNIX timestamp of the last comment, and $likeData , which contains data related to the likes for the disabled comments. person.tpl # templates/person.tpl 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 {capture assign='pageTitle'}{$person} - {lang}wcf.person.list{/lang}{/capture} {capture assign='contentTitle'}{$person}{/capture} {include file='header'} {if $person->enableComments} {if $commentList|count || $commentCanAdd} <section id=\"comments\" class=\"section sectionContainerList\"> <header class=\"sectionHeader\"> <h2 class=\"sectionTitle\"> {lang}wcf.person.comments{/lang} {if $person->comments}<span class=\"badge\">{#$person->comments}</span>{/if} </h2> </header> {include file='__commentJavaScript' commentContainerID='personCommentList'} <div class=\"personComments\"> <ul id=\"personCommentList\" class=\"commentList containerList\" {* *}data-can-add=\"{if $commentCanAdd}true{else}false{/if}\" {* *}data-object-id=\"{@$person->personID}\" {* *}data-object-type-id=\"{@$commentObjectTypeID}\" {* *}data-comments=\"{if $person->comments}{@$commentList->countObjects()}{else}0{/if}\" {* *}data-last-comment-time=\"{@$lastCommentTime}\" {* *}> {include file='commentListAddComment' wysiwygSelector='personCommentListAddComment'} {include file='commentList'} </ul> </div> </section> {/if} {/if} <footer class=\"contentFooter\"> {hascontent} <nav class=\"contentFooterNavigation\"> <ul> {content}{event name='contentFooterNavigation'}{/content} </ul> </nav> {/hascontent} </footer> {include file='footer'} For now, the person template is still very empty and only shows the comments in the content area. The template code shown for comments is very generic and used in this form in many locations as it only sets the header of the comment list and the container ul#personCommentList element for the comments shown by commentList template. The ul#personCommentList elements has five additional data- attributes required by the JavaScript API for comments for loading more comments or creating new ones. The commentListAddComment template adds the WYSIWYG support. The attribute wysiwygSelector should be the id of the comment list personCommentList with an additional AddComment suffix. page.xml # page.xml 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <data xmlns= \"http://www.woltlab.com\" xmlns:xsi= \"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation= \"http://www.woltlab.com http://www.woltlab.com/XSD/5.4/page.xsd\" > <import> <page identifier= \"com.woltlab.wcf.people.PersonList\" > <pageType> system </pageType> <controller> wcf\\page\\PersonListPage </controller> <name language= \"de\" > Personen-Liste </name> <name language= \"en\" > Person List </name> <content language= \"de\" > <title> Personen </title> </content> <content language= \"en\" > <title> People </title> </content> </page> <page identifier= \"com.woltlab.wcf.people.Person\" > <pageType> system </pageType> <controller> wcf\\page\\PersonPage </controller> <handler> wcf\\system\\page\\handler\\PersonPageHandler </handler> <name language= \"de\" > Person </name> <name language= \"en\" > Person </name> <requireObjectID> 1 </requireObjectID> <parent> com.woltlab.wcf.people.PersonList </parent> </page> </import> </data> The page.xml file has been extended for the new person page with identifier com.woltlab.wcf.people.Person . Compared to the pre-existing com.woltlab.wcf.people.PersonList page, there are four differences: It has a <handler> element with a class name as value. This aspect will be discussed in more detail in the next section. There are no <content> elements because, both, the title and the content of the page are dynamically generated in the template. The <requireObjectID> tells the system that this page requires an object id to properly work, in this case a valid person id. This page has a <parent> page, the person list page. In general, the details page for any type of object that is listed on a different page has the list page as its parent.

As we want administrators to link to specific people in menus, for example, we have to also implement the ILookupPageHandler interface by extending the AbstractLookupPageHandler class. For the ILookupPageHandler interface, we need to implement three methods: getLink($objectID) returns the link to the person page with the given id. In this case, we simply delegate this method call to the Person object returned by PersonRuntimeCache::getObject() . isValid($objectID) returns true if the person with the given id exists, otherwise false . Here, we use PersonRuntimeCache::getObject() again and check if the return value is null , which is the case for non-existing people. lookup($searchString) is used when setting up an internal link and when searching for the linked person. This method simply searches the first and last name of the people and returns an array with the person data. While the link , the objectID , and the title element are self-explanatory, the image element can either contain an HTML <img> tag, which is displayed next to the search result (WoltLab Suite uses an image tag for users showing their avatar, for example), or a FontAwesome icon class (starting with fa- ). Additionally, the class also implements IOnlineLocationPageHandler which is used to determine the online location of users. To ensure upwards-compatibility if the IOnlineLocationPageHandler interface changes, the TOnlineLocationPageHandler trait is used. The IOnlineLocationPageHandler interface requires two methods to be implemented: getOnlineLocation(Page $page, UserOnline $user) returns the textual description of the online location. The language item for the user online locations should use the pattern wcf.page.onlineLocation.{page identifier} . prepareOnlineLocation(Page $page, UserOnline $user) is called for each user online before the getOnlineLocation() calls. In this case, calling prepareOnlineLocation() first enables us to add all relevant person ids to the person runtime cache so that for all getOnlineLocation() calls combined, only one database query is necessary to fetch all person objects. This concludes the third part of our tutorial series after which each person has a dedicated page on which people can comment on the person.

More information about comment permissions can be found here . The getLink() method returns the link to the person with the passed comment id. As in isAccessible() , PersonRuntimeCache is used to potentially save database queries. The isAccessible() method checks if the active user can access the relevant person. As we do not have any special restrictions for accessing people, we only need to check if the person exists. The getTitle() method returns the title used for comments and responses, which is just a generic language item in this case. The updateCounter() updates the comments\u2019 counter of the person. We have added a new comments database table column to the wcf1_person database table in order to keep track on the number of comments. Additionally, we have added a new enableComments database table column to the wcf1_person database table whose value can be set when creating or editing a person in the ACP. With this option, comments on individual people can be disabled.

The rest of the code only handles fetching the list of comments on the requested person. In readData() , this list is fetched using CommentHandler::getCommentList() if comments are enabled for the person. The assignVariables() method assigns some additional template variables like $commentCanAdd , which is 1 if the active person can add comments and is 0 otherwise, $lastCommentTime , which contains the UNIX timestamp of the last comment, and $likeData , which contains data related to the likes for the disabled comments.","title":"PersonPage"},{"location":"tutorial/series/part_3/#persontpl","text":"templates/person.tpl 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 {capture assign='pageTitle'}{$person} - {lang}wcf.person.list{/lang}{/capture} {capture assign='contentTitle'}{$person}{/capture} {include file='header'} {if $person->enableComments} {if $commentList|count || $commentCanAdd} <section id=\"comments\" class=\"section sectionContainerList\"> <header class=\"sectionHeader\"> <h2 class=\"sectionTitle\"> {lang}wcf.person.comments{/lang} {if $person->comments}<span class=\"badge\">{#$person->comments}</span>{/if} </h2> </header> {include file='__commentJavaScript' commentContainerID='personCommentList'} <div class=\"personComments\"> <ul id=\"personCommentList\" class=\"commentList containerList\" {* *}data-can-add=\"{if $commentCanAdd}true{else}false{/if}\" {* *}data-object-id=\"{@$person->personID}\" {* *}data-object-type-id=\"{@$commentObjectTypeID}\" {* *}data-comments=\"{if $person->comments}{@$commentList->countObjects()}{else}0{/if}\" {* *}data-last-comment-time=\"{@$lastCommentTime}\" {* *}> {include file='commentListAddComment' wysiwygSelector='personCommentListAddComment'} {include file='commentList'} </ul> </div> </section> {/if} {/if} <footer class=\"contentFooter\"> {hascontent} <nav class=\"contentFooterNavigation\"> <ul> {content}{event name='contentFooterNavigation'}{/content} </ul> </nav> {/hascontent} </footer> {include file='footer'} For now, the person template is still very empty and only shows the comments in the content area. The template code shown for comments is very generic and used in this form in many locations as it only sets the header of the comment list and the container ul#personCommentList element for the comments shown by commentList template. The ul#personCommentList elements has five additional data- attributes required by the JavaScript API for comments for loading more comments or creating new ones. The commentListAddComment template adds the WYSIWYG support.

As we want administrators to link to specific people in menus, for example, we have to also implement the ILookupPageHandler interface by extending the AbstractLookupPageHandler class. For the ILookupPageHandler interface, we need to implement three methods: getLink($objectID) returns the link to the person page with the given id. In this case, we simply delegate this method call to the Person object returned by PersonRuntimeCache::getObject() . isValid($objectID) returns true if the person with the given id exists, otherwise false . Here, we use PersonRuntimeCache::getObject() again and check if the return value is null , which is the case for non-existing people. lookup($searchString) is used when setting up an internal link and when searching for the linked person. This method simply searches the first and last name of the people and returns an array with the person data. While the link , the objectID , and the title element are self-explanatory, the image element can either contain an HTML <img> tag, which is displayed next to the search result (WoltLab Suite uses an image tag for users showing their avatar, for example), or a FontAwesome icon class (starting with fa- ). Additionally, the class also implements IOnlineLocationPageHandler which is used to determine the online location of users. To ensure upwards-compatibility if the IOnlineLocationPageHandler interface changes, the TOnlineLocationPageHandler trait is used. The IOnlineLocationPageHandler interface requires two methods to be implemented: getOnlineLocation(Page $page, UserOnline $user) returns the textual description of the online location. The language item for the user online locations should use the pattern wcf.page.onlineLocation.{page identifier} . prepareOnlineLocation(Page $page, UserOnline $user) is called for each user online before the getOnlineLocation() calls. In this case, calling prepareOnlineLocation() first enables us to add all relevant person ids to the person runtime cache so that for all getOnlineLocation() calls combined, only one database query is necessary to fetch all person objects. This concludes the third part of our tutorial series after which each person has a dedicated page on which people can comment on the person. The complete source code of this part can be found on GitHub .","title":"PersonPageHandler"},{"location":"tutorial/series/part_4/","text":"Part 4: Box and Box Conditions # In this part of our tutorial series, we add support for creating boxes listing people.

Box Controller # In addition to static boxes with fixed contents, administrators are able to create dynamic boxes with contents from the database. In our case here, we want administrators to be able to create boxes listing people. To do so, we first have to register a new object type for this person list box controller for the object type definition com.woltlab.wcf.boxController : 1 2 3 4 5 <type> <name> com.woltlab.wcf.personList </name> <definitionname> com.woltlab.wcf.boxController </definitionname> <classname> wcf\\system\\box\\PersonListBoxController </classname> </type> The com.woltlab.wcf.boxController object type definition requires the provided class to implement wcf\\system\\box\\IBoxController : files/lib/system/box/PersonListBoxController.class.php 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 <? php namespace wcf\\system\\box ; use wcf\\data\\person\\PersonList ; use wcf\\system\\WCF ; /** * Dynamic box controller implementation for a list of persons. * * @author Matthias Schmidt * @copyright 2001-2021 WoltLab GmbH * @license GNU Lesser General Public License <http://opensource.org/licenses/lgpl-license.php> * @package WoltLabSuite\\Core\\System\\Box */ class PersonListBoxController extends AbstractDatabaseObjectListBoxController { /** * @inheritDoc */ protected $conditionDefinition = 'com.woltlab.wcf.box.personList.condition' ; /** * @inheritDoc */ public $defaultLimit = 5 ; /** * @inheritDoc */ protected $sortFieldLanguageItemPrefix = 'wcf.person' ; /** * @inheritDoc */ protected static $supportedPositions = [ 'sidebarLeft' , 'sidebarRight' , ]; /** * @inheritDoc */ public $validSortFields = [ 'firstName' , 'lastName' , 'comments' , ]; /** * @inheritDoc */ protected function getObjectList () { return new PersonList (); } /** * @inheritDoc */ protected function getTemplate () { return WCF :: getTPL () -> fetch ( 'boxPersonList' , 'wcf' , [ 'boxPersonList' => $this -> objectList , 'boxSortField' => $this -> sortField , 'boxPosition' => $this -> box -> position , ], true ); } } By extending AbstractDatabaseObjectListBoxController , we only have to provide minimal data ourself and rely mostly on the default implementation provided by AbstractDatabaseObjectListBoxController : As we will support conditions for the listed people, we have to set the relevant condition definition via $conditionDefinition . AbstractDatabaseObjectListBoxController already supports restricting the number of listed objects. To do so, you only have to specify the default number of listed objects via $defaultLimit . AbstractDatabaseObjectListBoxController also supports setting the sort order of the listed objects. You have to provide the supported sort fields via $validSortFields and specify the prefix used for the language items of the sort fields via $sortFieldLanguageItemPrefix so that for every $validSortField in $validSortFields , the language item {$sortFieldLanguageItemPrefix}.{$validSortField} must exist. The box system supports different positions . Each box controller specifies the positions it supports via $supportedPositions . To keep the implementation simple here as different positions might require different output in the template, we restrict ourselves to sidebars. getObjectList() returns an instance of DatabaseObjectList that is used to read the listed objects. getObjectList() itself must not call readObjects() , as AbstractDatabaseObjectListBoxController takes care of calling the method after adding the conditions and setting the sort order. getTemplate() returns the contents of the box relying on the boxPersonList template here: templates/boxPersonList.tpl 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 <ul class=\"sidebarItemList\"> { foreach from = $boxPersonList item = boxPerson } <li class=\"box24\"> <span class=\"icon icon24 fa-user\"></span> <div class=\"sidebarItemTitle\"> <h3> { anchor object = $boxPerson } </h3> { capture assign = '__boxPersonDescription' }{ lang __optional = true } wcf.person.boxList.description. { $boxSortField }{ /lang }{ /capture } { if $__boxPersonDescription } <small> { @ $__boxPersonDescription } </small> { /if } </div> </li> { /foreach } </ul> The template relies on a .sidebarItemList element, which is generally used for sidebar listings. (If different box positions were supported, we either have to generate different output by considering the value of $boxPosition in the template or by using different templates in getTemplate() .) One specific piece of code is the $__boxPersonDescription variable, which supports an optional description below the person's name relying on the optional language item wcf.person.boxList.description.{$boxSortField} . We only add one such language item when sorting the people by comments: In such a case, the number of comments will be shown. (When sorting by first and last name, there are no additional useful information that could be shown here, though the plugin from part 2 adding support for birthdays might also show the birthday when sorting by first or last name.) Lastly, we also provide the language item wcf.acp.box.boxController.com.woltlab.wcf.personList , which is used in the list of available box controllers. Conditions # The condition system can be used to generally filter a list of objects. In our case, the box system supports conditions to filter the objects shown in a specific box. Admittedly, our current person implementation only contains minimal data so that filtering might not make the most sense here but it will still show how to use the condition system for boxes. We will support filtering the people by their first and last name so that, for example, a box can be created listing all people with a specific first name. The first step for condition support is to register a object type definition for the relevant conditions requiring the IObjectListCondition interface: objectTypeDefinition.xml 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <data xmlns= \"http://www.woltlab.com\" xmlns:xsi= \"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation= \"http://www.woltlab.com http://www.woltlab.com/XSD/5.4/objectTypeDefinition.xsd\" > <import> <definition> <name> com.woltlab.wcf.box.personList.condition </name> <interfacename> wcf\\system\\condition\\IObjectListCondition </interfacename> </definition> </import> </data> Next, we register the specific conditions for filtering by the first and last name using this object type condition: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 <type> <name> com.woltlab.wcf.people.firstName </name> <definitionname> com.woltlab.wcf.box.personList.condition </definitionname> <classname> wcf\\system\\condition\\person\\PersonFirstNameTextPropertyCondition </classname> </type> <type> <name> com.woltlab.wcf.people.lastName </name> <definitionname> com.woltlab.wcf.box.personList.condition </definitionname> <classname> wcf\\system\\condition\\person\\PersonLastNameTextPropertyCondition </classname> </type> PersonFirstNameTextPropertyCondition and PersonLastNameTextPropertyCondition only differ minimally so that we only focus on PersonFirstNameTextPropertyCondition here, which relies on the default implementation AbstractObjectTextPropertyCondition and only requires specifying different object properties: files/lib/system/condition/person/PersonFirstNameTextPropertyCondition.class.php 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 <? php namespace wcf\\system\\condition\\person ; use wcf\\data\\person\\Person ; use wcf\\system\\condition\\AbstractObjectTextPropertyCondition ; /** * Condition implementation for the first name of a person. * * @author Matthias Schmidt * @copyright 2001-2021 WoltLab GmbH * @license WoltLab License <http://www.woltlab.com/license-agreement.html> * @package WoltLabSuite\\Core\\System\\Condition */ class PersonFirstNameTextPropertyCondition extends AbstractObjectTextPropertyCondition { /** * @inheritDoc */ protected $className = Person :: class ; /** * @inheritDoc */ protected $description = 'wcf.person.condition.firstName.description' ; /** * @inheritDoc */ protected $fieldName = 'personFirstName' ; /** * @inheritDoc */ protected $label = 'wcf.person.firstName' ; /** * @inheritDoc */ protected $propertyName = 'firstName' ; /** * @inheritDoc */ protected $supportsMultipleValues = true ; } $className contains the class name of the relevant database object from which the class name of the database object list is derived and $propertyName is the name of the database object's property that contains the value used for filtering.

The wcf1_person_information table has been added for the PersonInformation model. The meaning of the different columns is explained in the property documentation part of PersonInformation 's documentation (see below). The two foreign keys ensure that if a person is deleted, all of their information is also deleted, and that if a user is deleted, the userID column is set to NULL . files/lib/data/person/information/PersonInformation.class.php 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 <? php namespace wcf\\data\\person\\information ; use wcf\\data\\DatabaseObject ; use wcf\\data\\person\\Person ; use wcf\\data\\user\\UserProfile ; use wcf\\system\\cache\\runtime\\PersonRuntimeCache ; use wcf\\system\\cache\\runtime\\UserProfileRuntimeCache ; use wcf\\system\\html\\output\\HtmlOutputProcessor ; use wcf\\system\\WCF ; /** * Represents a piece of information for a person. * * @author Matthias Schmidt * @copyright 2001-2021 WoltLab GmbH * @license GNU Lesser General Public License <http://opensource.org/licenses/lgpl-license.php> * @package WoltLabSuite\\Core\\Data\\Person\\Information * * @property-read int $informationID unique id of the information * @property-read int $personID id of the person the information belongs to * @property-read string $information information text * @property-read int|null $userID id of the user who added the information or `null` if the user no longer exists * @property-read string $username name of the user who added the information * @property-read int $time timestamp at which the information was created */ class PersonInformation extends DatabaseObject { /** * Returns `true` if the active user can delete this piece of information and `false` otherwise. */ public function canDelete () : bool { if ( WCF :: getUser () -> userID && WCF :: getUser () -> userID == $this -> userID && WCF :: getSession () -> getPermission ( 'user.person.canDeleteInformation' ) ) { return true ; } return WCF :: getSession () -> getPermission ( 'mod.person.canDeleteInformation' ); } /** * Returns `true` if the active user can edit this piece of information and `false` otherwise. */ public function canEdit () : bool { if ( WCF :: getUser () -> userID && WCF :: getUser () -> userID == $this -> userID && WCF :: getSession () -> getPermission ( 'user.person.canEditInformation' ) ) { return true ; } return WCF :: getSession () -> getPermission ( 'mod.person.canEditInformation' ); } /** * Returns the formatted information. */ public function getFormattedInformation () : string { $processor = new HtmlOutputProcessor (); $processor -> process ( $this -> information , 'com.woltlab.wcf.people.information' , $this -> informationID ); return $processor -> getHtml (); } /** * Returns the person the information belongs to. */ public function getPerson () : Person { return PersonRuntimeCache :: getInstance () -> getObject ( $this -> personID ); } /** * Returns the user profile of the user who added the information. */ public function getUserProfile () : UserProfile { if ( $this -> userID ) { return UserProfileRuntimeCache :: getInstance () -> getObject ( $this -> userID ); } else { return UserProfile :: getGuestUserProfile ( $this -> username ); } } } PersonInformation provides two methods, canDelete() and canEdit() , to check whether the active user can delete or edit a specific piece of information. In both cases, it is checked if the current user has created the relevant piece of information to check the user-specific permissions or to fall back to the moderator-specific permissions. There also two getter methods for the person, the piece of information belongs to ( getPerson() ), and for the user profile of the user who created the information ( getUserProfile() ). In both cases, we use runtime caches, though in getUserProfile() , we also have to consider the case of the user who created the information being deleted, i.e. userID being null . For such a case, we also save the name of the user who created the information in username , so that we can return a guest user profile object in this case. The most interesting method is getFormattedInformation() , which returns the HTML code of the information text meant for output. To generate such an output, HtmlOutputProcessor::process() is used and here is where we first use the associated message object type com.woltlab.wcf.people.information mentioned before . While PersonInformationEditor is simply the default implementation and thus not explicitly shown here, PersonInformationList::readObjects() caches the relevant ids of the associated people and users who created the pieces of information using runtime caches: files/lib/data/person/information/PersonInformationList.class.php 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 <? php namespace wcf\\data\\person\\information ; use wcf\\data\\DatabaseObjectList ; use wcf\\system\\cache\\runtime\\PersonRuntimeCache ; use wcf\\system\\cache\\runtime\\UserProfileRuntimeCache ; /** * Represents a list of person information. * * @author Matthias Schmidt * @copyright 2001-2021 WoltLab GmbH * @license GNU Lesser General Public License <http://opensource.org/licenses/lgpl-license.php> * @package WoltLabSuite\\Core\\Data\\PersonInformation * * @method PersonInformation current() * @method PersonInformation[] getObjects() * @method PersonInformation|null search($objectID) * @property PersonInformation[] $objects */ class PersonInformationList extends DatabaseObjectList { public function readObjects () { parent :: readObjects (); UserProfileRuntimeCache :: getInstance () -> cacheObjectIDs ( \\array_unique ( \\array_filter ( \\array_column ( $this -> objects , 'userID' )))); PersonRuntimeCache :: getInstance () -> cacheObjectIDs ( \\array_unique ( \\array_column ( $this -> objects , 'personID' ))); } } Listing and Deleting Person Information #

Additionally, we always list all pieces of information. If there are many pieces of information, a nicer solution would be a pagination or loading more pieces of information with JavaScript. First, we note the jsObjectActionContainer class in combination with the data-object-action-class-name attribute, which are needed for the delete button for each piece of information, as explained here . In PersonInformationAction , we have overridden the default implementations of validateDelete() and delete() which are called after clicking on a delete button. In validateDelete() , we call PersonInformation::canDelete() on all pieces of information to be deleted for proper permission validation, and in delete() , we update the informationCount values of the people the deleted pieces of information belong to (see below). The button to add a new piece of information, #personInformationAddButton , and the buttons to edit existing pieces of information, .jsEditInformation , are controlled with JavaScript code initialized at the very end of the template. Lastly, in create() we provide default values for the time , userID , username , and ipAddress for cases like here when creating a new piece of information, where do not explicitly provide this data. Additionally, we extract the information text from the information_htmlInputProcessor parameter provided by the associated WYSIWYG form field and update the number of pieces of information created for the relevant person. Creating and Editing Person Information # To create new pieces of information or editing existing ones, we do not add new form controllers but instead use dialogs generated by the form builder API so that the user does not have to leave the person page. When clicking on the add button or on any of the edit buttons, a dialog opens with the relevant form: ts/WoltLabSuite/Core/Controller/Person.ts 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 /** * Provides the JavaScript code for the person page. * * @author Matthias Schmidt * @copyright 2001-2021 WoltLab GmbH * @license GNU Lesser General Public License <http://opensource.org/licenses/lgpl-license.php> * @module WoltLabSuite/Core/Controller/Person */ import FormBuilderDialog from \"WoltLabSuite/Core/Form/Builder/Dialog\" ; import * as Language from \"WoltLabSuite/Core/Language\" ; import * as UiNotification from \"WoltLabSuite/Core/Ui/Notification\" ; let addDialog : FormBuilderDialog ; const editDialogs = new Map < string , FormBuilderDialog > (); interface EditReturnValues { formattedInformation : string ; informationID : number ; } interface Options { canAddInformation : true ; } /** * Opens the edit dialog after clicking on the edit button for a piece of information. */ function editInformation ( event : Event ) : void { event . preventDefault (); const currentTarget = event . currentTarget as HTMLElement ; const information = currentTarget . closest ( \".jsObjectActionObject\" ) as HTMLElement ; const informationId = information . dataset . objectId ! ; if ( ! editDialogs . has ( informationId )) { editDialogs . set ( informationId , new FormBuilderDialog ( `personInformationEditDialog ${ informationId } ` , \"wcf\\\\data\\\\person\\\\information\\\\PersonInformationAction\" , \"getEditDialog\" , { actionParameters : { informationID : informationId , }, dialog : { title : Language.get ( \"wcf.person.information.edit\" ), }, submitActionName : \"submitEditDialog\" , successCallback ( returnValues : EditReturnValues ) { document . getElementById ( `personInformation ${ returnValues . informationID } ` ) ! . innerHTML = returnValues . formattedInformation ; UiNotification . show ( Language . get ( \"wcf.person.information.edit.success\" )); }, }, ), ); } editDialogs . get ( informationId ) ! . open (); } /** * Initializes the JavaScript code for the person page. */ export function init ( personId : number , options : Options ) : void { if ( options . canAddInformation ) { // Initialize the dialog to add new information. addDialog = new FormBuilderDialog ( \"personInformationAddDialog\" , \"wcf\\\\data\\\\person\\\\information\\\\PersonInformationAction\" , \"getAddDialog\" , { actionParameters : { personID : personId , }, dialog : { title : Language.get ( \"wcf.person.information.add\" ), }, submitActionName : \"submitAddDialog\" , successCallback () { UiNotification . show ( Language . get ( \"wcf.person.information.add.success\" ), () => window . location . reload ()); }, }, ); document . getElementById ( \"personInformationAddButton\" ) ! . addEventListener ( \"click\" , ( event ) => { event . preventDefault (); addDialog . open (); }); } document . querySelectorAll ( \".jsEditInformation\" ) . forEach (( el ) => el . addEventListener ( \"click\" , ( ev ) => editInformation ( ev ))); } We use the WoltLabSuite/Core/Form/Builder/Dialog module , which takes care of the internal handling with regard to these dialogs. We only have to provide some data during for initializing these objects and call the open() function after a button has been clicked. Explanation of the initialization arguments for WoltLabSuite/Core/Form/Builder/Dialog used here: The first argument is the id of the dialog used to identify it. The second argument is the PHP class name which provides the contents of the dialog's form and handles the data after the form is submitted. The third argument is the name of the method in the referenced PHP class in the previous argument that returns the dialog form. The fourth argument contains additional options: actionParameters are additional parameters send during each AJAX request. Here, we either pass the id of the person for who a new piece of information is added or the id of the edited piece of information. dialog contains the options for the dialog, see the DialogOptions interface. Here, we only provide the title of the dialog. submitActionName is the name of the method in the referenced PHP class that is called with the form data after submitting the form. successCallback is called after the submit AJAX request was successful. After adding a new piece of information, we reload the page, and after editing an existing piece of information, we update the existing information text with the updated text.

In addition to these two methods, the matching validation methods validateGetAddDialog() and validateGetAddDialog() are also added. As the forms for adding and editing pieces of information have the same structure, this form is created in buildDialog() using a DialogFormDocument object, which is intended for forms in dialogs. We fire an event in buildDialog() so that plugins are able to easily extend the dialog with additional data. validateGetAddDialog() checks if the user has the permission to create new pieces of information and if a valid id for the person, the information will belong to, is given. The method configured in the WoltLabSuite/Core/Form/Builder/Dialog object returning the dialog is expected to return two values: the id of the form ( formId ) and the contents of form shown in the dialog ( dialog ). This data is returned by getAddDialog using the dialog build previously by buildDialog() . After the form is submitted, validateSubmitAddDialog() has to do the same basic validation as validateGetAddDialog() so that validateGetAddDialog() is simply called. Additionally, the form data is read and validated. In submitAddDialog() , we first check if there have been any validation errors: If any error occured during validation, we return the same data as in getAddDialog() so that the dialog is shown again with the erroneous fields marked as such. Otherwise, if the validation succeeded, the form data is used to create the new piece of information. In addition to the form data, we manually add the id of the person to whom the information belongs to. Lastly, we could return some data that we could access in the JavaScript callback function after successfully submitting the dialog. As we will simply be reloading the page, no such data is returned. An alternative to reloading to the page would be dynamically inserting the new piece of information in the list so that we would have to return the rendered list item for the new piece of information. The process for getting and submitting the dialog to edit existing pieces of information is similar to the process for adding new pieces of information. Instead of the id of the person, however, we now pass the id of the edited piece of information and in submitEditDialog() , we update the edited information instead of creating a new one like in submitAddDialog() . After editing a piece of information, we do not reload the page but dynamically update the text of the information in the TypeScript code so that we return the updated rendered information text and id of the edited pieced of information in submitAddDialog() .

In both cases, it is checked if the current user has created the relevant piece of information to check the user-specific permissions or to fall back to the moderator-specific permissions. There also two getter methods for the person, the piece of information belongs to ( getPerson() ), and for the user profile of the user who created the information ( getUserProfile() ). In both cases, we use runtime caches, though in getUserProfile() , we also have to consider the case of the user who created the information being deleted, i.e. userID being null . For such a case, we also save the name of the user who created the information in username , so that we can return a guest user profile object in this case. The most interesting method is getFormattedInformation() , which returns the HTML code of the information text meant for output. To generate such an output, HtmlOutputProcessor::process() is used and here is where we first use the associated message object type com.woltlab.wcf.people.information mentioned before . While PersonInformationEditor is simply the default implementation and thus not explicitly shown here, PersonInformationList::readObjects() caches the relevant ids of the associated people and users who created the pieces of information using runtime caches: files/lib/data/person/information/PersonInformationList.class.php 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 <? php namespace wcf\\data\\person\\information ; use wcf\\data\\DatabaseObjectList ; use wcf\\system\\cache\\runtime\\PersonRuntimeCache ; use wcf\\system\\cache\\runtime\\UserProfileRuntimeCache ; /** * Represents a list of person information. * * @author Matthias Schmidt * @copyright 2001-2021 WoltLab GmbH * @license GNU Lesser General Public License <http://opensource.org/licenses/lgpl-license.php> * @package WoltLabSuite\\Core\\Data\\PersonInformation * * @method PersonInformation current() * @method PersonInformation[] getObjects() * @method PersonInformation|null search($objectID) * @property PersonInformation[] $objects */ class PersonInformationList extends DatabaseObjectList { public function readObjects () { parent :: readObjects (); UserProfileRuntimeCache :: getInstance () -> cacheObjectIDs ( \\array_unique ( \\array_filter ( \\array_column ( $this -> objects , 'userID' )))); PersonRuntimeCache :: getInstance () -> cacheObjectIDs ( \\array_unique ( \\array_column ( $this -> objects , 'personID' ))); } }","title":"Person Information Model"},{"location":"tutorial/series/part_5/#listing-and-deleting-person-information","text":"The person.tpl template has been updated to include a block for listing the information at the beginning: templates/person.tpl 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 121 122 123 124 125 126 127 128 129 130 131 132 133 134 135 136 137 138 139 140 141 { capture assign = 'pageTitle' }{ $person } - { lang } wcf.person.list { /lang }{ /capture } { capture assign = 'contentTitle' }{ $person }{ /capture } { include file = 'header' } { if $person -> informationCount || $__wcf -> session -> getPermission ( 'user.person.canAddInformation' ) } <section class=\"section sectionContainerList\"> <header class=\"sectionHeader\"> <h2 class=\"sectionTitle\"> { lang } wcf.person.information.list { /lang } { if $person -> informationCount } <span class=\"badge\"> { #

Additionally, we always list all pieces of information. If there are many pieces of information, a nicer solution would be a pagination or loading more pieces of information with JavaScript. First, we note the jsObjectActionContainer class in combination with the data-object-action-class-name attribute, which are needed for the delete button for each piece of information, as explained here . In PersonInformationAction , we have overridden the default implementations of validateDelete() and delete() which are called after clicking on a delete button. In validateDelete() , we call PersonInformation::canDelete() on all pieces of information to be deleted for proper permission validation, and in delete() , we update the informationCount values of the people the deleted pieces of information belong to (see below). The button to add a new piece of information, #personInformationAddButton , and the buttons to edit existing pieces of information, .jsEditInformation , are controlled with JavaScript code initialized at the very end of the template. Lastly, in create() we provide default values for the time , userID , username , and ipAddress for cases like here when creating a new piece of information, where do not explicitly provide this data. Additionally, we extract the information text from the information_htmlInputProcessor parameter provided by the associated WYSIWYG form field and update the number of pieces of information created for the relevant person.","title":"Listing and Deleting Person Information"},{"location":"tutorial/series/part_5/#creating-and-editing-person-information","text":"To create new pieces of information or editing existing ones, we do not add new form controllers but instead use dialogs generated by the form builder API so that the user does not have to leave the person page.

We only have to provide some data during for initializing these objects and call the open() function after a button has been clicked. Explanation of the initialization arguments for WoltLabSuite/Core/Form/Builder/Dialog used here: The first argument is the id of the dialog used to identify it. The second argument is the PHP class name which provides the contents of the dialog's form and handles the data after the form is submitted. The third argument is the name of the method in the referenced PHP class in the previous argument that returns the dialog form. The fourth argument contains additional options: actionParameters are additional parameters send during each AJAX request. Here, we either pass the id of the person for who a new piece of information is added or the id of the edited piece of information. dialog contains the options for the dialog, see the DialogOptions interface. Here, we only provide the title of the dialog. submitActionName is the name of the method in the referenced PHP class that is called with the form data after submitting the form. successCallback is called after the submit AJAX request was successful. After adding a new piece of information, we reload the page, and after editing an existing piece of information, we update the existing information text with the updated text. (Dynamically inserting a newly added piece of information instead of reloading the page would also be possible, of course, but for this tutorial series, we kept things simple.) Next, we focus on PersonInformationAction , which actually provides the contents of these dialogs and creates and edits the information: files/lib/data/person/information/PersonInformationAction.class.php 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 121 122 123 124 125 126 127 128 129 130 131 132 133 134 135 136 137 138 139 140 141 142 143 144 145 146 147 148 149 150 151 152 153 154 155 156 157 158 159 160 161 162 163 164 165 166 167 168 169 170 171 172 173 174 175 176 177 178 179 180 181 182 183 184 185 186 187 188 189 190 191 192 193 194 195 196 197 198 199 200 201 202 203 204 205 206 207 208 209 210 211 212 213 214 215 216 217 218 219 220 221 222 223 224 225 226 227 228 229 230 231 232 233 234 235 236 237 238 239 240 241 242 243 244 245 246 247 248 249 250 251 252 253 254 255 256 257 258 259 260 261 262 263 264 265 266 267 268 269 270 271 272 273 274 275 276 277 278 279 280 281 282 283 284 285 286 287 288 289 290 291 292 293 294 295 296 297 298 299 300 301 302 303 304 <?

In addition to these two methods, the matching validation methods validateGetAddDialog() and validateGetAddDialog() are also added. As the forms for adding and editing pieces of information have the same structure, this form is created in buildDialog() using a DialogFormDocument object, which is intended for forms in dialogs. We fire an event in buildDialog() so that plugins are able to easily extend the dialog with additional data. validateGetAddDialog() checks if the user has the permission to create new pieces of information and if a valid id for the person, the information will belong to, is given. The method configured in the WoltLabSuite/Core/Form/Builder/Dialog object returning the dialog is expected to return two values: the id of the form ( formId ) and the contents of form shown in the dialog ( dialog ). This data is returned by getAddDialog using the dialog build previously by buildDialog() . After the form is submitted, validateSubmitAddDialog() has to do the same basic validation as validateGetAddDialog() so that validateGetAddDialog() is simply called. Additionally, the form data is read and validated. In submitAddDialog() , we first check if there have been any validation errors: If any error occured during validation, we return the same data as in getAddDialog() so that the dialog is shown again with the erroneous fields marked as such. Otherwise, if the validation succeeded, the form data is used to create the new piece of information. In addition to the form data, we manually add the id of the person to whom the information belongs to. Lastly, we could return some data that we could access in the JavaScript callback function after successfully submitting the dialog. As we will simply be reloading the page, no such data is returned. An alternative to reloading to the page would be dynamically inserting the new piece of information in the list so that we would have to return the rendered list item for the new piece of information. The process for getting and submitting the dialog to edit existing pieces of information is similar to the process for adding new pieces of information. Instead of the id of the person, however, we now pass the id of the edited piece of information and in submitEditDialog() , we update the edited information instead of creating a new one like in submitAddDialog() . After editing a piece of information, we do not reload the page but dynamically update the text of the information in the TypeScript code so that we return the updated rendered information text and id of the edited pieced of information in submitAddDialog() .","title":"Creating and Editing Person Information"},{"location":"tutorial/series/part_5/#rebuild-data-worker","text":"To ensure the integrity of the person data, PersonRebuildDataWorker updates the informationCount counter: files/lib/system/worker/PersonRebuildDataWorker.class.php 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 <? php namespace wcf\\system\\worker ; use wcf\\data\\person\\PersonList ; use wcf\\system\\WCF ; /** * Worker implementation for updating people. * * @author Matthias Schmidt * @copyright 2001-2021 WoltLab GmbH * @license GNU Lesser General Public License <http://opensource.org/licenses/lgpl-license.php> * @package WoltLabSuite\\Core\\System\\Worker * * @method PersonList getObjectList() */ class PersonRebuildDataWorker extends AbstractRebuildDataWorker { /** * @inheritDoc */ protected $limit = 500 ; /** * @inheritDoc */ protected $objectListClassName = PersonList :: class ; /** * @inheritDoc */ protected function initObjectList () { parent :: initObjectList (); $this -> objectList -> sqlOrderBy = 'person.personID' ; } /** * @inheritDoc */ public function execute () { parent :: execute (); if ( ! \\count ( $this -> objectList )) { return ; } $sql = \"UPDATE wcf\" .

The activity points are awarded when new pieces are created via PersonInformation::create() using UserActivityPointHandler::fireEvent() and removed in PersonInformation::create() via UserActivityPointHandler::removeEvents() if pieces of information are deleted.

The easiest way to use the template plugin is to pass it an instance of ITitledLinkObject : 1 { anchor object = $object } generates the same output as 1 <a href=\" { $object -> getLink () } \"> { $object -> getTitle () } </a> Instead of an object parameter, a link and content parameter can be used: 1 { anchor link = $linkObject content = $content } where $linkObject implements ILinkableObject and $content is either an object implementing ITitledObject or having a __toString() method or $content is a string or a number. The last special attribute is append whose contents are appended to the href attribute of the generated anchor element. All of the other attributes matching ~^[a-z]+([A-z]+)+$~ , expect for href which is disallowed, are added as attributes to the anchor element. If an object attribute is present, the object also implements IPopoverObject and if the return value of IPopoverObject::getPopoverLinkClass() is included in the class attribute of the anchor tag, data-object-id is automatically added. This functionality makes it easy to generate links with popover support. Instead of 1 <a href=\" { $entry -> getLink () } \" class=\"blogEntryLink\" data-object-id=\" { $entry -> entryID } \"> { $entry -> subject } </a> using 1 { anchor object = $entry class = 'blogEntryLink' } is sufficient if Entry::getPopoverLinkClass() returns blogEntryLink . 5.3+ anchorAttributes # anchorAttributes compliments the StringUtil::getAnchorTagAttributes(string, bool): string method.

If append is used on an array as the variable, the value is appended to all elements of the array. assign # New template variables can be declared and new values can be assigned to existing template variables using assign : 1 2 3 { assign var = templateVariable value = 'newValue' } { $templateVariable } { * prints 'newValue * } capture # In some situations, assign is not sufficient to assign values to variables in templates if the value is complex.

One prominent example is a template event: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 { if $foo === 'bar' } <ul> { if $foo === 'bar' } <li>Bar</li> { /if } { event name = 'listItems' } </li> { /if } In this example, if $foo !== 'bar' , the list will not be shown, regardless of the additional template code provided by template listeners. In such a situation, hascontent has to be used: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 { hascontent } <ul> { content } { if $foo === 'bar' } <li>Bar</li> { /if } { event name = 'listItems' } { /content } </ul> { /hascontent } If the part of the template wrapped in the content tags has any (trimmed) content, the part of the template wrapped by hascontent tags is shown (including the part wrapped by the content tags), otherwise nothing is shown. Thus, this construct avoids an empty list compared to the if solution above. Like foreach , hascontent also supports an else part: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 { hascontent } <ul> { content } { * \u2026 * } { /content } </ul> { hascontentelse } no list { /hascontent } htmlCheckboxes # htmlCheckboxes generates a list of HTML checkboxes. 1 2 3 { htmlCheckboxes name = foo options = $fooOptions selected = $currentFoo } { htmlCheckboxes name = bar output = $barLabels values = $barValues selected = $currentBar } Attribute Description 5.2+ disabled if true , all checkboxes are disabled disableEncoding if true , the values are not passed through wcf\\util\\StringUtil::encodeHTML() ; false by default name name attribute of the input checkbox element output array used as keys and values for options if present; not present by default options array selectable options with the key used as value attribute and the value as the checkbox label selected current selected value(s) separator separator between the different checkboxes in the generated output; empty string by default values array with values used in combination with output , where output is only used as keys for options htmlOptions # htmlOptions generates an select HTML element. 1 2 3 4 5 6 { htmlOptions name = 'foo' options = $options selected = $selected } <select name=\"bar\"> <option value=\"\" { if !

Templates are text files with .tpl as the file extension. WoltLab Suite Core compiles the template files once into a PHP file that is executed when a user requests the page. In subsequent request, as the PHP file containing the compiled template already exists, compiling the template is not necessary anymore. Template Types and Conventions # WoltLab Suite Core supports two types of templates: frontend templates (or simply templates ) and backend templates ( ACP templates ). Each type of template is only available in its respective domain, thus frontend templates cannot be included or used in the ACP and vice versa. For pages and forms, the name of the template matches the unqualified name of the PHP class except for the Page or Form suffix: RegisterForm.class.php \u2192 register.tpl UserPage.class.php \u2192 user.tpl If you follow this convention, WoltLab Suite Core will automatically determine the template name so that you do not have to explicitly set it. For forms that handle creating and editing objects, in general, there are two form classes: FooAddForm and FooEditForm . WoltLab Suite Core, however, generally only uses one template fooAdd.tpl and the template variable $action to distinguish between creating a new object ( $action = 'add' ) and editing an existing object ( $action = 'edit' ) as the differences between templates for adding and editing an object are minimal. Installing Templates # Templates and ACP templates are installed by two different package installation plugins: the template PIP and the ACP template PIP .

Thus, this method is relevant when printing numbers and having them formatted correctly according the the user\u2019s language. {@$foo} will result in the contents of $foo to be printed directly. In general, this method should not be used for user-generated input. Multiple template variables can be assigned by passing an array: 1 2 3 4 WCF :: getTPL () -> assign ([ 'foo' => 'bar' , 'baz' => false ]); Modifiers # If you want to call a function on a variable, you can use the modifier syntax: {@$foo|trim} , for example, results in the trimmed contents of $foo to be printed. System Template Variable # The template variable $tpl is automatically assigned and is an array containing different data: $tpl[get] contains $_GET . $tpl[post] contains $_POST . $tpl[cookie] contains $_COOKIE . $tpl[server] contains $_SERVER . $tpl[env] contains $_ENV . $tpl[now] contains TIME_NOW (current timestamp). Furthermore, the following template variables are also automatically assigned: $__wcf contains the WCF object (or WCFACP object in the backend). Comments # Comments are wrapped in {* and *} and can span multiple lines: 1 2 { * some comment * } The template compiler discards the comments, so that they not included in the compiled template. Conditions # Conditions follow a similar syntax to PHP code: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 { if $foo === 'bar' } foo is bar { elseif $foo === 'baz' } foo is baz { else } foo is neither bar nor baz { /if } The supported operators in conditions are === , !== , == , != , <= , < , >= , > , || , && , ! , and = . More examples: 1 2 3 { if $bar | isset } \u2026 { /if } { if $bar | count > 3 && $bar | count < 100 } \u2026 { /if } Foreach Loops # Foreach loops allow to iterate over arrays or iterable objects: 1 2 3 4 5 <ul> { foreach from = $array key = key item = value } <li> { $key } : { $value } </li> { /foreach } </ul> While the from attribute containing the iterated structure and the item attribute containg the current value are mandatory, the key attribute is optional. If the foreach loop has a name assigned to it via the name attribute, the $tpl template variable provides additional data about the loop: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 <ul> { foreach from = $array key = key item = value name = foo } { if $tpl [ foreach ][ foo ][ first ] } something special for the first iteration { elseif $tpl [ foreach ][ foo ][ last ] } something special for the last iteration { /if } <li>iteration { # $tpl [ foreach ][ foo ][ iteration ]+ 1 } out of { # $tpl [ foreach ][ foo ][ total ] } { $key } : { $value } </li> { /foreach } </ul> In contrast to PHP\u2019s foreach loop, templates also support foreachelse : 1 2 3 4 5 { foreach from = $array item = value } \u2026 { foreachelse } there is nothing to iterate over { /foreach } Including Other Templates # To include template named foo from the same domain (frontend/backend), you can use 1 { include file = 'foo' } If the template belongs to an application, you have to specify that application using the application attribute: 1 { include file = 'foo' application = 'app' } Additional template variables can be passed to the included template as additional attributes: 1 { include file = 'foo' application = 'app' var1 = 'foo1' var2 = 'foo2' } Template Plugins # An overview of all available template plugins can be found here .","title":"Templates"},{"location":"view/templates/#templates","text":"Templates are responsible for the output a user sees when requesting a page (while the PHP code is responsible for providing the data that will be shown).

Each type of template is only available in its respective domain, thus frontend templates cannot be included or used in the ACP and vice versa. For pages and forms, the name of the template matches the unqualified name of the PHP class except for the Page or Form suffix: RegisterForm.class.php \u2192 register.tpl UserPage.class.php \u2192 user.tpl If you follow this convention, WoltLab Suite Core will automatically determine the template name so that you do not have to explicitly set it. For forms that handle creating and editing objects, in general, there are two form classes: FooAddForm and FooEditForm . WoltLab Suite Core, however, generally only uses one template fooAdd.tpl and the template variable $action to distinguish between creating a new object ( $action = 'add' ) and editing an existing object ( $action = 'edit' ) as the differences between templates for adding and editing an object are minimal.","title":"Template Types and Conventions"},{"location":"view/templates/#installing-templates","text":"Templates and ACP templates are installed by two different package installation plugins: the template PIP and the ACP template PIP .
